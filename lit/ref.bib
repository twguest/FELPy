	abstract = {Theory predicts that with a very short and very intense X-ray pulse, the image of a single diﬀraction pattern may be recorded from a large macromolecule, a virus, or a nanocluster of proteins without the need for a crystal. A three-dimensional data set can be assembled from such images when many copies of the molecule are exposed to the beam one by one in random orientations. We outline a method for structure reconstruction from such a data set in which no independent information is available about the orientation of the images. The basic requirement for reconstruction and/or signal averaging is the ability to tell whether two noisy diﬀraction patterns represent the same view of the sample or two diﬀerent views. With this knowledge, averaging techniques can be used to enhance the signal and extend the resolution in a redundant data set. Based on statistical properties of the diﬀraction pattern, we present an analytical solution to the classiﬁcation problem. The solution connects the number of incident X-ray photons with the particle size and the achievable resolution. The results are surprising in that they show that classiﬁcation can be done with less than one photon per pixel in the limiting resolution shell, assuming Poisson-type photon noise in the image. The results can also be used to provide criteria for improvements in other image classiﬁcation procedures, e.g., those used in electron tomography or diﬀraction.},

	abstract = {The Single Particles, Clusters and Biomolecules (SPB) instrument at the European XFEL is located behind the SASE1 undulator, and aims to support imaging and structure determination of biological specimen between about 0.1 micrometer and 1 micrometer size. The instrument is designed to work at photon energies from 3 keV up to 16 keV. This wide operation range is a cause for challenges to the focusing optics. In particular, a long propagation distance of about 900 m between x-ray source and sample leads to a large lateral photon beam size at the optics. The beam divergence is the most important parameter for the optical system, and is largest for the lowest photon energies and for the shortest pulse duration (corresponding to the lowest charge). Due to the large divergence of nominal X-ray pulses with duration shorter than 10 fs, one suffers diffraction from mirror aperture, leading to a 100-fold decrease in fluence at photon energies around 4 keV, which are ideal for imaging of single biomolecules. The nominal SASE1 output power is about 50 GW. This is very far from the level required for single biomolecule imaging, even assuming perfect beamline and focusing efficiency. Here we demonstrate that the parameters of the accelerator complex and of the SASE1 undulator offer an opportunity to optimize the SPB beamline for single biomolecule imaging with minimal additional costs and time. Start to end simulations from the electron injector at the beginning of the accelerator complex up to the generation of diffraction data indicate that one can achieve diffraction without diffraction with about 0.5 photons per Shannon pixel at near-atomic resolution with 1e13 photons in a 4 fs pulse at 4 keV photon energy and in a 100 nm focus, corresponding to a fluence of 1e23 ph/cm{\textasciicircum}2. This result is exemplified using the RNA Pol II molecule as a case study.},

	abstract = {Several strategies in phase retrieval are unified by an iterative "difference map" constructed from a pair of elementary projections and a single real parameter \${\textbackslash}beta\$. For the standard application in optics, where the two projections implement Fourier modulus and object support constraints respectively, the difference map reproduces the "hybrid" form of Fienup's input-output map for \${\textbackslash}beta = 1\$. Other values of \${\textbackslash}beta\$ are equally effective in retrieving phases but have no input-output counterparts. The geometric construction of the difference map illuminates the distinction between its fixed points and the recovered object, as well as the mechanism whereby stagnation is avoided. When support constraints are replaced by object histogram or atomicity constraints, the difference map lends itself to crystallographic phase retrieval. Numerical experiments with synthetic data suggest that structures with hundreds of atoms can be solved.},

	abstract = {This paper reports novel measurements of x-ray optical radiation on an absolute scale from the intense and ultra-short radiation generated in the soft x-ray regime of a free electron laser. We give a brief description of the detection principle for radiation measurements which was specifically adapted for this photon energy range. We present data characterizing the soft x-ray instrument at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) with respect to the radiant power output and transmission by using an absolute detector temporarily placed at the downstream end of the instrument. This provides an estimation of the reflectivity of all x-ray optical elements in the beamline and provides the absolute photon number per bandwidth per pulse. This parameter is important for many experiments that need to understand the trade-offs between high energy resolution and high flux, such as experiments focused on studying materials via resonant processes. Furthermore, the results are compared with the LCLS diagnostic gas detectors to test the limits of linearity, and observations are reported on radiation contamination from spontaneous undulator radiation and higher harmonic content.},

Scheduled to begin operation in 2009, this first-ofa-kind X-ray source will produce ultra-short X-ray pulses of unprecedented brightness in the 0.8 to 8 keV first harmonic photon energy regime. Much effort has been invested in predicting and modeling the XFEL photon source properties at the undulator exit; however, as most LCLS experiments are ultimately dependent on the beam focal spot properties it is equally as important to understand the XFEL beam at the endstations where the experiments are performed. Here, we use newly available precision surface metrology data from actual LCLS mirrors combined with a scalar diffraction model to predict the LCLS beam properties in the experiment chambers.},

On the other hand, the speckle contrasts measured at a large wavevector yields information about the longitudinal coherence of the LCLS radiation after a silicon (111) monochromator. The quantitative agreement between our data and the simulation conﬁrms a mean coherence time of 2.2 fs and a x-ray pulse duration of 29 fs. Finally the observed reduction of the speckle contrast generated by x-rays with pulse duration longer than 30 fs indicates ultrafast dynamics taking place at an atomic length scale prior to the permanent sample damage.},

In addition, a computationally eﬃcient approximate solution for TEM00 mode is derived providing high accuracy (better than 1\% in the whole range of parameters).

Our studies show that optimum performance of the XFEL in terms of transverse coherence is achieved at the value of the parameter {\textasciicircum}  of about unity. At smaller values of {\textasciicircum}  the degree of transverse coherence is reduced due to strong inﬂuence of poor longitudinal coherence on a transverse one. At large values of the emittance the degree of transverse coherence degrades due to poor mode selection.

	abstract = {The baseline design of present XFEL projects only considers the production of a single photon beam at ﬁxed wavelength from each baseline undulator. At variance, the scheme described in this paper considers the simultaneous production of high intensity SASE FEL radiation at three diﬀerent wavelengths. We present a feasibility study of our scheme, and we make exempliﬁcations with parameters of the baseline SASE2 line of the European XFEL operating in simultaneous mode at 0.05 nm, 0.15 nm and 0.4 nm. Our technique for generating the two colors at 0.05 nm and 0.15 nm is based in essence on a ”fresh bunch” technique. For the generation of radiation at 0.4 nm we propose to use an ”afterburner” technique. Implementation of these techniques does not perturb the baseline mode of operation of the SASE2 undulator. The present paper also describes an eﬃcient way to obtain a multi-user facility. It is shown that, although the XFEL photon beam from a given undulator is meant for a single user, movable multilayer X-ray mirrors can be used to serve many users simultaneously. The proposed photon beam distribution system would allow to switch the FEL beam quickly between many experiments in order to make an eﬃcient use of the source. Distribution of photons is achieved on the basis of pulse trains and it is possible to distribute the multicolor photon beam among many independent beam lines, thereby enabling many users to work in parallel with diﬀerent wavelengths.},

	abstract = {When observing from the ground one has to deal with the turbulence from the atmosphere and the turbulence caused by the telescope's surroundings. In order to find the best sites for future solar telescopes and develop multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) for them, the contributions to seeing have to be characterized for heights up to at least 12 km above the telescope.   This characterization is done with a method that measures differential image displacements using several subapertures. By extending the ordinary DIMM- and S-DIMM-methods to measure displacements at different field angles, the height distribution of seeing can be measured. This extended method is called S-DIMM+, where the letter S denotes the use of the Sun as source and the + signifies that it is an extension of the former methods.   Observations are made with the Wide Field Wavefront Sensor (WFWFS) mounted at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) at La Palma. The results from these measurements are compared with the Shadow Band Ranger (SHABAR), also mounted on the SST.   The first results of these comparisons show good correlation between the two instruments for heights up to 500 m. Results from the WFWFS also show that the dominant seeing at this site comes from layers close to the ground and at high altitude and that Fried's parameter, r\_0, is larger than 40 cm for the intermediate layers.},

	abstract = {The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is the world’s first hard X-ray free-electron laser. First proposed in 1992, the LCLS concept immediately attracted the interest of accelerator physicists in the synchrotron light source community. Interest among x-ray researchers grew slowly until about 1996, when scientists at DESY produced a concept for a large x-ray laser research facility (now the European XFEL). The US Department of Energy (DOE) conducted formal assessments of the science potential of accelerator-based x-ray lasers between 1992 and 2001 when DOE officially acknowledged that such a device should be built. The DOE assessments and their conclusions demonstrate how a young researcher can have a preview, over seven years in advance, of important new science facilities and their capabilities. In 2002, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory prepared a conceptual design of LCLS. By this time, the LCLS concept had grown from a minimum-cost test to a versatile facility supporting the research of thousands of x-ray experimenters. Groundbreaking for construction of LCLS began in 2006, and first lasing at 8 keV was observed in April 2009. This chapter describes some of the most significant physics and engineering problems and solutions: performance of the electron source, such as the potential deleterious effects of coherent synchrotron radiation instabilities, precision control of magnetic fields in the undulators.},

@book{grizolli_optical_2016,
	address = {Lund},
	title = {Optical {Studies} {For} {Synchrotron} {Radiation} {Beamlines}},
	abstract = {Popular Abstract in English Among the large variety of experiments performed in science, a common one is to pass a light beam through a sample, the object to be studied, and to study the outcomes of the light-sample interaction. Many light sources have been used for this purpose, like light bulbs and lasers. A modern light source used nowadays is the so-called storage ring. In the storage rings electrons are accelerated and then stored, so that they circulate at a speed close to the speed of light. At these speeds the electrons emit a special kind of light when they travel in a bent path: the synchrotron light. The main property of the synchrotron light is that it is very concentrated (a high flux in a small area) and that it covers very high energies, from the ultraviolet light (UV) to the X-rays (UV and X-rays are in their nature just like visible light, but with higher energy). Before reaching the sample under study, the properties of the UV light and of the X-rays must be modified to meet the requirements of the experiments. This is done with optical elements like mirrors, lenses, gratings and crystals. The concept is similar to what is done in experiments with visible light, but UV light and X-rays have some particularities which require operating the optical devices in different manners. For instance, mirrors for X-ray need to operate at very small angles between the light beam and the mirror surface. This work discusses special solutions using UV and X-ray optics developed for synchrotron light. One of them focuses in an optical design that exploits the high quality of the light sources in MAX II and in MAX IV in order to improve the flexibility of the experiments. The second part of the work describes a device for measuring the polarization of light (one of its properties) that passes through the sample. The last part studies how the wave properties of light affects the performance of the optics. Synchrotron radiation sources have greatly contributed to the progress in many fields of science. The development of the storage ring technologies has made possible to obtain very low emittance electron beams, which together with the use of undulators allow guiding a very high photon flux into a very small spot required by the experiments. Development of the sources has been accompanied with equally strong progress in beamline optics, improving further experimental conditions and opening new possibilities in science. This follows from the fact that beamlines have to transport the photon beam from the source to the experiment while conserving the beam quality and the photon flux of the source as good as possible. This work uses basic concepts of X-ray optics to develop beamlines and beamline instrumentation. First, a beamline design that uses astigmatism is discussed. This project takes advantage of the low vertical emittance of the MAX II and MAX IV storage rings to improve the flexibility of soft X-ray beamlines. Secondly a polarimeter is introduced, a device that characterizes the polarization of the light at the experimental station. In this part a new method is presented for analyzing the polarimeter data. Finally, applying wave optics to X-ray optics is presented and discussed. It is shown how new tools were added into wave propagation modeling, taking into account surface errors of the optical components used in grazing incidence. For these studies the source properties, X-ray interaction with matter together with many concepts in optics are needed and are also presented here.},

	abstract = {Coherent ptychographic imaging experiments often discard the majority of the flux from a light source to define the coherence of the illumination. Even when the coherent flux is sufficient, the stability required during an exposure is another important limiting factor. Partial coherence analysis can considerably reduce these limitations. A partially coherent illumination can often be written as the superposition of a single coherent illumination convolved with a separable translational kernel. This article proposes the gradient decomposition of the probe (GDP), a model that exploits translational kernel separability, coupling the variances of the kernel with the transverse coherence. An efficient first-order splitting algorithm (
              GDP-ADMM
              ) for solving the proposed nonlinear optimization problem is described. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with Gaussian and binary kernel functions in fly-scan measurements. Remarkably,
              GDP-ADMM
              using nanoprobes produces satisfactory results even when the ratio between the kernel width and the beam size is more than one, or when the distance between successive acquisitions is twice as large as the beam width.},

The synthesis procedure of these beams relies on the incoherent superposition of their coherent modes being Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) functions having a variable radial mode and a fixed azimuthal mode carrying the Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM). As a result of such construction the correlation functions of these random beams have separable phase carrying the OAM with the index inherited from the coherent modes. The coherence states of these beams are controlled by the distribution of weights of the coherent modes in superposition, varying from perfectly coherent to nearly incoherent. We explore the effects of the cycling rates of the SLM and the DMD used for source synthesis on the average intensity and the scintillation index of the generated beams having different OAM indices and coherence states after propagation in atmospheric turbulence. Our analysis indicates that for fairly incoherent beams with sufficiently large OAM index and high cycling rates the atmospheric turbulence can be efficiently mitigated.},

Across this period, X-ray crystallography was the most important experimental method for gaining atomic-resolution insight into protein structures. However, as the role of dynamics gained importance in the function of proteins, the limitations of X-ray crystallography in not being able to capture dynamics came to the forefront. Computational methods proved to be immensely successful in understanding protein dynamics in solution, and they continue to improve in terms of both the scale and the types of systems that can be studied. In this review, we brieﬂy discuss the limitations of X-ray crystallography in studying protein dynamics, and then provide an overview of different computational methods that are instrumental in understanding the dynamics of proteins and biomacromolecular complexes.},

One method greatly reduces computer memory requirements, making this type of synthesis more practical. The utility of all three methods is demonstrated via a modiﬁed form of Young's experiment. Numerical simulation and laboratory results for time-averaged irradiance are presented and compared with theory to validate the synthesis techniques.},

Such waves are termed the Cosine-Gaussian Schell-model (CGSM) pulses. The analytic expression for the temporal mutual coherence function of the CGSM pulse in dispersive media is derived and used to study the evolution of its intensity distribution and its temporal degree of coherence. Further, the numerical calculations are performed in order to show the dependence of the intensity profile and the temporal degree of coherence of the CGSM pulse on the incident pulse duration, the initial temporal coherence length, the order-parameter n and the dispersion of the medium. The most important feature of the novel pulsed wave is its ability to split into two pulses on passage in a dispersive medium at some critical propagation distance. Such critical distance and the subsequent evolution of the split pulses are shown to depend on the source parameters and on the properties of the medium in which the pulse travels.},

Wavelengths between λ = 32 nm and λ = 8 nm are examined. A decrease of the coherence time for the fundamental wavelengths from τc = (6 ± 0.5) fs at 32 nm to τc = (2.9 ± 0.5) fs at 8 nm is measured. At λ = 8 nm the fundamental wavelength and the third harmonic of 24 nm are compared to each other. For 8 nm radiation as third harmonic of 24 nm a coherence time of τc = (2.5 ± 0.5) fs is observed. The spatial coherence of 24 nm and 8 nm fundamental pulses are found to be very similar. The visibility decreases to 50\% of the maximum visibility at about 3.2 mm overlap of the partial beams, which corresponds to 42\% of the beam diameter (FWHM) at a distance of 90 m from the exit of the undulator. These results are analysed in terms of the Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) resulting in six contributing modes to the total radiation. In addition, the correlation of the visibility between the fundamental radiation at 24 nm and its third harmonic at λ = 8 nm is investigated for identical shots.},

	abstract = {High harmonic generation (HHG) is an established means of producing coherent, short wavelength, ultrafast pulses from a compact set-up. Table-top high-harmonic sources are increasingly being used to image physical and biological systems using emerging techniques such as coherent diffraction imaging and ptychography. These novel imaging methods require coherent illumination and it is therefore important to both characterize the spatial coherence of high-harmonic beams and understand the processes which limit this property. Here we investigate the near- and far-field spatial properties of high-harmonic radiation generated in a gas cell. The variation with harmonic order of the intensity profile, wavefront curvature and complex coherence factor is measured in the far-field by the SCIMITAR technique. Using the Gaussian-Schell model, the properties of the harmonic beam in the plane of generation are deduced. Our results show that the order-dependence of the harmonic spatial coherence is consistent with partial coherence induced by both variation of the intensity-dependent dipole phase as well as finite spatial coherence of the driving radiation. These findings are used to suggest ways in which the coherence of harmonic beams could be increased further, which would have direct benefits to imaging with high-harmonic radiation.},

In our proof-of-concept low-fluence experiment the tomogram with Paganin-type phase-retrieval filter applied exhibited an effective net boost of \$23{\textbackslash}pm 1\$ in the signal-to-noise ratio as compared to an attenuation-based tomogram, implying an effective boost in neutron brilliance of well over two orders of magnitude. The phase-retrieval filter applies to monochromatic as well as poly-energetic neutron beams. Expressions are provided for the optimal phase-contrast geometry as well as conditions for the validity of the method. The underpinning theory is derived under the assumption of the sample being composed of a single material, but this can be generalized. The effective boost in brilliance may be employed to give reduced acquisition time, or may instead be used to keep exposure times fixed while improving contrast and spatial resolution.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01452},
	abstract = {X-ray imaging has conventionally relied upon attenuation to provide contrast. In recent years, two complementary modalities have been added; a) phase contrast, which can capture low-density samples that are difﬁcult to see using attenuation, and b) dark-ﬁeld x-ray imaging, which reveals the presence of sub-pixel sample structures. These three modalities can be accessed using a crystal analyser, a grating interferometer or by looking at a directly-resolved grid, grating or speckle pattern. Grating and grid-based methods extract a differential phase signal by measuring how far a feature in the illumination has been shifted transversely due to the presence of a sample. The dark-ﬁeld signal is extracted by measuring how the visibility of the structured illumination is decreased, typically due to the presence of sub-pixel structures in a sample. The strength of the dark-ﬁeld signal may depend on the grating period, the pixel size and the set-up distances, and additional dark-ﬁeld signal contributions may be seen as a result of strong phase effects or other factors. In this paper we show that the ﬁnite-difference form of the Fokker–Planck equation can be applied to describe the drift (phase signal) and diffusion (dark-ﬁeld signal) of the periodic or structured illumination used in phase contrast x-ray imaging with gratings, in order to better understand any cross-talk between attenuation, phase and dark-ﬁeld x-ray signals. In future work, this mathematical description could be used as a basis for new approaches to the inverse problem of recovering both phase and dark-ﬁeld information.},

These speckles are generated by passing x rays through a suitable spatially random mask. The method makes use of a single image obtained in the presence of the object, which serves to deform the illuminating speckle field relative to a reference speckle field (which need only be measured once) obtained in the presence of the mask and the absence of the object. The method implicitly rather than explicitly tracks speckles, and utilizes the transport-of-intensity equation to give a closed-form solution to the inverse problem of determining the complex transmission function of the object. Application to x-ray synchrotron data shows the method to be robust and efficient with respect to noise. Applications include x-ray phase--amplitude radiography and tomography, as well as time-dependent imaging of dynamic and radiation-sensitive samples using low-flux sources.},

This paper introduces a new operator, called guided mutation. Guided mutation generates offspring through combination of global statistical information and the location information of solutions found so far. An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) for the maximum clique problem is proposed in this paper. Besides guided mutation, EA/G adopts a strategy for searching different search areas in different search phases. Marchiori’s heuristic is applied to each new solution to produce a maximal clique in EA/G. Experimental results show that EA/G outperforms the heuristic genetic algorithm of Marchiori (the best evolutionary algorithm reported so far) and a MIMIC algorithm on DIMACS benchmark graphs.},

	abstract = {Background: Seed germination involves progression from complete metabolic dormancy to a highly active, growing seedling. Many factors regulate germination and these interact extensively, forming a complex network of inputs that control the seed-to-seedling transition. Our understanding of the direct regulation of gene expression and the dynamic changes in the epigenome and small RNAs during germination is limited. The interactions between genome, transcriptome and epigenome must be revealed in order to identify the regulatory mechanisms that control seed germination.
Results: We present an integrated analysis of high-resolution RNA sequencing, small RNA sequencing and MethylC sequencing over ten developmental time points in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, finding extensive transcriptomic and epigenomic transformations associated with seed germination. We identify previously unannotated loci from which messenger RNAs are expressed transiently during germination and find widespread alternative splicing and divergent isoform abundance of genes involved in RNA processing and splicing. We generate the first dynamic transcription factor network model of germination, identifying known and novel regulatory factors. Expression of both microRNA and short interfering RNA loci changes significantly during germination, particularly between the seed and the post-germinative seedling. These are associated with changes in gene expression and large-scale demethylation observed towards the end of germination, as the epigenome transitions from an embryo-like to a vegetative seedling state.
Conclusions: This study reveals the complex dynamics and interactions of the transcriptome and epigenome during seed germination, including the extensive remodelling of the seed DNA methylome from an embryo-like to vegetative-like state during the seed-to-seedling transition.

	abstract = {Interference lithography is an effective method of patterning periodic structures with limits set by light diffraction. Using this method at the short wavelengths of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray provides additional advantages such as high photoresist absorption and low proximity effects. Operating at these short wavelengths, however, associates technical challenges such as light source, optics, transmission masks, and photoresists. Several research groups around the world have set up infrastructures to utilize interference lithography at this wavelength range for different applications. In this article we brieﬂy review the works of these groups in terms of their light source, instrumentation, and achievements. We present more technical in-depth description of the illumination light source arrangements at our XIL-II beamline at the Swiss Light Source and the tabletop system at RWTH Aachen. We describe high-resolution mask fabrication and implementation, as well as achievements in photoresist patterning at cutting-edge resolutions. Moreover, we describe other methods of patterning at these wavelength regimes, such as Beyond EUV lithography, making tall nanostructures, and Talbot lithography. In addition, we show some of the applications of EUV-IL in nanoscience.},

The success, impact and performance of these new forms of bi-directional and networked interactions can provide insights to understand compliance with the mandate of the Open Government Initiative. Many government agencies are experimenting with the use of social media, however very few actively measure the impact of their digital interactions. This article builds on insights from social media directors in the U.S. federal government highlighting their current lack of measurement practices for social media interactions. Based on their articulated needs for measurement, existing rules regulating the extent of measurement practices and technological features of the main social media platforms, a framework is presented that traces online interactions to mission support and the resulting social media tactics. Implications for both researchers and practitioners are discussed.},

However, the information transmission mechanism in lithography systems is not yet completely understood. This paper studies and analyzes the lithography imaging process from an information theory perspective. The optical lithography system is regarded as an information channel, an approximate statistical model is built to depict the imaging process, and information theoretical aspects of coherent optical lithography systems are studied. Based on that, we derive the mutual information between the mask pattern and print image, as well as the maximum information transfer (MIT) of the coherent lithography system. This paper also reveals and discusses the physical meaning of MIT in the lithography imaging process. Finally, a method to calculate the theoretical limit of image ﬁdelity using the MIT is proposed and veriﬁed by a set of simulations.},

Literature reveals that genetic algorithms play an increasingly important role in the computing FFT for the design and implementation of the foresaid devices. In this paper, a multi- objective genetic algorithm for computing Fast Fourier Transform for evolving smart sensor devices has been designed and simulated in software in a field programmable gateway array using Altera Quartus II 13.0. Programmable logic units, ( Luts-representing genes in a chromosome) were designed using schematic /block diagrams and hardware description language and they were encoded into chromosomes and then optimized using field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) to achieve desired goals of portability and low energy consumption. The performance of our design was evaluated using Altera Quartus II Powerplay power analyser tool in terms of core static thermal power dissipation, core dynamic thermal power dissipation and input and output thermal power dissipation. The model was also evaluated in terms of functional correctness and portability. The results show significant improvements in all performance measures.},

	abstract = {We have studied the photolysis of tin clusters of the type [(RSn)12O14(OH)6] X2 using extreme ultraviolet (EUV, 13.5 nm) light, and developed these clusters into novel high-resolution photoresists. A thin ﬁlm of [(BuSn)12O14(OH)6][p-toluenesulfonate]2 (1) was prepared by spin coating a solution of (1) in 2-butanone onto a silicon wafer. Exposure to EUV light caused the compound (1) to be converted into a substance that was markedly less soluble in aqueous isopropanol. To optimize the EUV lithographic performance of resists using tin-oxo clusters, and to gain insight into the mechanism of their photochemical reactions, we prepared several compounds based on [(RSn)12O14(OH)6] X2. The sensitivity of tin-oxide ﬁlms to EUV light were studied as a function of variations in the structure of the counter-anions (X, primarily carboxylates) and organic ligands bound to tin (R). Correlations were sought between the EUV sensitivity of these complexes vs. the strength of the carbon–carboxylate bonds in the counter-anions and vs. the strength of the carbon–tin bonds. No correlation was observed between the strength of the carbon–carboxylate bonds in the counter-anions (X) and the EUV photosensitivity. However, the EUV sensitivity of the tin-oxide ﬁlms appears to be well-correlated with the strength of the carbon–tin bonds. We hypothesize this correlation indicates a mechanism of carbon–tin bond homolysis during exposure. Using these tin clusters, 18-nm lines were printed showcasing the high resolution capabilities of these materials as photoresists for EUV lithography.},

The drastic narrowing of these peaks was observed in the spectra of the laser-produced plasma. It was explained by a change of the 4d104f m–4d94f m+1 (m {\textgreater} 2) transition arrays mostly contributing to the intensity of the peaks in the vacuum spark spectra for the 4–4 transitions in the simplest spectra of the 4p64dk (k = 8–10) and 4d104f m (m = 1–2) ground conﬁguration ions predominantly excited in hotter laser-produced plasma.

	abstract = {The mechanism of capacity fade of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 (M = Li, Ni, Co, Mn) composite positive electrode within a full cell was investigated using a combination of operando neutron powder diffraction and transmission X-ray microscopy methods, enabling the phase, crystallographic, and morphological evolution of the material during electrochemical cycling to be understood. The electrode was shown to initially consist of 73(1) wt \% R3m LiMO2 with the remaining 27(1) wt \% C2/m Li2MnO3 likely existing as an intergrowth. Cracking in the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode particle under operando microscopy observation was revealed to be initiated by the solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase on charge to 4.55 V vs Li+/Li and intensified during further charge to 4.7 V vs Li+/Li during the concurrent two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase, involving the largest lattice change of any phase, and oxygen evolution from the Li2MnO3 phase. Notably, significant healing of the generated cracks in the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode particle occurred during subsequent lithiation on discharge, with this rehealing being principally associated with the solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase. This work reveals that while it is the reduction of lattice size of electrode phases during charge that results in cracking of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode particle, with the extent of cracking correlated to the magnitude of the size change, crack healing is possible in the reverse solid-solution reaction occurring during discharge. Importantly, it is the phase separation during the two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase that prevents the complete healing of the electrode particle, leading to pulverization over extended cycling. This work points to the minimization of behavior leading to phase separation, such as twophase and oxygen evolution, as a key strategy in preventing capacity fade of the electrode.},

	abstract = {Consumers are adopting increasingly active roles in co-creating marketing content with companies and their respective brands. In turn, companies and organizations are looking to online social marketing programs and campaigns in an effort to reach consumers where they ‘live’ online. However, the challenge facing many companies is that although they recognize the need to be active in social media, they do not truly understand how to do it effectively, what performance indicators they should be measuring, and how they should measure them. Further, as companies develop social media strategies, platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are too often treated as stand-alone elements rather than part of an integrated system. This article offers a systematic way of understanding and conceptualizing online social media, as an ecosystem of related elements involving both digital and traditional media. We highlight a best-practice case study of an organization’s successful efforts to leverage social media in reaching an important audience of young consumers. Then, we conclude with several insights and lessons related to the strategic integration of social media into a ﬁrm’s marketing communications strategy.},

The spectral absorption and the shift in the λmax of I2 upon complexation have been exploited to determine the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of Tweens, Brijs, and Triton X-100. The CMC values obtained closely agree with those determined by other methods, including measurements of static surface tension, differential refractive index, and iodine solubilization. The spectral characteristics of the complex salt KI3 can be utilized as well to derive similar information. The CMC and the spectral shift can be correlated with the weight fraction of the polyoxyethylene groups and the hydrophile–lipophile balance (HLB) in various ways, with the parameters in these relationships depending on the series to which the surfactant belong. Because both CMC and HLB depend on temperature, the results and the relations obtained are temperature-dependent; those presented are with reference to 298 K.},

	abstract = {X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XRFM) is a powerful technique to detect and localize elements in cells. To derive information useful for biology and medicine, it is essential not only to localize, but also to map quantitatively the element concentration. Here we applied quantitative XRFM to iron in phagocytic cells. Iron, a primary component of living cells, can become toxic when present in excess. In human fluids, free iron is maintained at 10-18 M concentration thanks to iron binding proteins as lactoferrin (Lf). The iron homeostasis, involving the physiological ratio of iron between tissues/secretions and blood, is strictly regulated by ferroportin, the sole protein able to export iron from cells to blood. Inflammatory processes induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or bacterial pathoge inhibit ferroportin synthesis in epithelial and phagocytic cells thus hindering iron export, increasing intracellular iron and bacterial multiplication. In this respect, Lf is emerging as an important regulator of both iron and inflammatory homeostasis. Here we studied phagocytic cells inflamed by bacterial LPS and untreated or treated with milk derived bovine Lf. Quantitative mapping of iron concentration and mass fraction at high spatial resolution is obtained combining X-ray fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy and synchrotron phase contrast imaging.},

	abstract = {The Dual Auroral Radar Network (DARN) is a global-scale network of HF and VHF radars capable of sensing backscatter from ionospheric irregularities in the E and F-regions of the high-latitude ionosphere. Currently, the network consists of the STARE VHF radar system in northern Scandinavia, a northern-hemisphere, longitudinal chain of HF radars that is funded to extend from Saskatoon, Canada to central Finland, and a southern-hemisphere chain that is funded to include Halley Station, SANAE and Syowa Station in Antarctica. When all of the HF radars have been completed they will operate in pairs with common viewing areas so that the Doppler information contained in the backscattered signals may be combined to yield maps of high-latitude plasma convection and the convection electric field. In this paper, the evolution of DARN and particularly the development of its SuperDARN HF radar element is discussed. The DARN/SuperDARN network is particularly suited to studies of large-scale dynamical processes in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system, such as the evolution of the global configuration of the convection electric field under changing IMF conditions and the development and global extent of large-scale MHD waves in the magnetosphere-ionosphere cavity. A description of the HF radars within SuperDARN is given along with an overview of their existing and intended locations, intended start of operations, Principal Investigators, and sponsoring agencies. Finally, the operation of the DARN experiment within ISTP/GGS, the availability of data, and the form and availability of the Key Parameter files is discussed.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the mechanical behavior of low-dimensional materials has been attracting lots of attention triggered both by the ongoing miniaturization and the extraordinary properties demonstrated for nanostructures. It is now well established that mechanical properties of small objects differ fundamentally from their bulk counterpart and in particular that ‘‘smaller is stronger” but many questions on the deformation mechanisms remain open. Most of the knowledge obtained on small- scale mechanics is based on ex-situ and insitu characterizations using electron microscopy. However, these techniques suffer from the fact that imaging or scattering information is either limited to the surface or from a 2D projection of a thin foil of material. Within the last two decades tremendous progress was achieved at 3rd generation synchrotrons making it possible to focus hard X-ray beams down to the 100-nm scale. Modern synchrotron X-ray diffraction methods may thus provide structural information with good spatial resolution and fully 3D. In this review, we discuss the progress achieved on in-situ micro- and nano-mechanical tests coupled with different synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques to monitor the elastic and plastic deformation, highlighting the advantages of these approaches, which offer at the same time versatile sample environments and extreme precision in displacement ﬁelds.},

These materials are nonchemically ampliﬁed systems based on Si, Zr, and Ti oxides, synthesized from organically modiﬁed precursors and transition metal alkoxides by a sol–gel route and designed for ultraviolet, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and electron beam lithography. The experiments were conducted using a scanning transmission x-ray microscope (STXM) which combines high spatial-resolution microscopy and NEXAFS spectroscopy. The absorption spectra were collected in the proximity of the carbon edge (∼290 eV) before and after in situ exposure, enabling the measurement of a signiﬁcant photo-induced degradation of the organic group (phenyl or methyl methacrylate, respectively), the degree of which depends on the conﬁguration of the ligand. Photo-induced degradation was more efﬁcient in the resist synthesized with pendant phenyl substituents than it was in the case of systems based on bridging phenyl groups. The degradation of the methyl methacrylate group was relatively efﬁcient, with about half of the initial ligands dissociated upon exposure. Our data reveal that such dissociation can produce different outcomes, depending on the structural conﬁguration. While all the organic groups were expected to detach and desorb from the resist in their entirety, a sizeable amount of them remained and formed undesired byproducts such as alkene chains. In the framework of the materials synthesis and engineering through speciﬁc building blocks, these results provide a deeper insight into the photochemistry of resists, in particular for EUV lithography.},

Nowadays, the optical lithography is the standard tool in the production of microelectronic circuits. One of the steps of the process is the illumination of a mask (exposure) where the masks pattern is transferred onto the object surface. The Fraunhofer Institute in Erlangen have developed a simulation program named Simulation of Optical Lithography in three Dimensions (SOLID) in the past few years. With the help of given parameters this system is able to model and analyze the lithography procedure. The next step of the project is the automatic optimization of these parameters. The big number of parameters characterize the complexity of the task. The theme of this paper – within this ﬁeld – is the optimization of the layout of the masks. A computer program is developed, which uses genetic algorithms for this optimization. The program is working as a module of SOLID.},

The eﬀects of bake temperature and developer concentration on the ultimate resolution, sensitivity and contrast are investigated. It is demonstrated that HSQ as a negative-tone photoresist provides patterns with half-pitches as small as 20 nm with EUV interference lithography. SEM micrographs show that the low line-edge roughness of the patterns is accompanied with the high-quality cross-sectional proﬁles. This high resolution and pattern quality are achieved through development in high-concentration developers for long development times, which is in line with previous results obtained with e-beam lithography.},

Due to its two dimensional nature, physical and chemical properties and ease of manipulation, graphene offers the possibility of integration with the existing semiconductor technology for next-generation electronic and sensing devices. In this context, the understanding of the graphene/semiconductor interface is of great importance since it can constitute a versatile standalone device as well as the buildingblock of more advanced electronic systems. Since graphene was brought to the attention of the scientific community in 2004, the device research has been focused on the more complex graphene transistors, while the graphene/semiconductor junction, despite its importance, has started to be the subject of systematic investigation only recently. As a result, a thorough understanding of the physics and the potentialities of this device is still missing. The studies of the past few years have demonstrated that graphene can form junctions with 3D or 2D semiconducting materials which have rectifying characteristics and behave as excellent Schottky diodes. The main novelty of these devices is the tunable Schottky barrier height, a feature which makes the graphene/semiconductor junction a great platform for the study of interface transport mechanisms as well as for applications in photo-detection, high-speed communications, solar cells, chemical and biological sensing, etc. In this paper, we review the state-of-the art of the research on graphene/semiconductor junctions, the attempts towards a modeling and the most promising applications.},

	abstract = {Science is the attempt to make the chaotic diversity of our sense-experience to a logically uniﬁed system of thought. A sound theoretical basis and a rational physicochemical understanding based on experimental ﬁndings lead to a proper understanding of a topic. Colloid chemistry strengthened its footing by the extensive studies on gold sols by Michael Faraday in 1850s, however, the term ‘‘colloid’’ was coined by Thomas Graham in 1861. Historically, the Stone Age paintings in the Lascaux cave in France and the written records of Egyptian pharaohs were produced with stabilized colloid pigments. The part of colloid science dealing with amphiphilic molecules is so diverse on its own that it is dealt in a separate branch called the ‘‘association colloid’’. A key development in the study of association colloids was the observation by James McBain that the osmotic pressure of salts of alkali metal fatty acid displayed a pronounced break in the concentration beyond a speciﬁc characteristic concentration, after which the osmotic coefﬁcient remained almost constant (Evans and Wennerstrom, 1994). McBain attributed this fact to the self-association of these molecules among themselves (McBain, 1913, 1944) in solution. Here, we are providing a molecular as well as thermodynamic approach toward the micellization process.},

	abstract = {Information is a key concept in evolutionary biology. Information is stored in biological organism’s genomes, and used to generate the organism as well as to maintain and control it. Information is also “that which evolves”. When a population adapts to a local environment, information about this environment is fixed in a representative genome. However, when an environment changes, information can be lost. At the same time, information is processed by animal brains to survive in complex environments, and the capacity for information processing also evolves. Here I review applications of information theory to the evolution of proteins as well as to the evolution of information processing in simulated agents that adapt to perform a complex task.},

The possibility of excipient interference is not precluded and this factor, coupled with use of a fixed reference absorptivity value, can sometimes lead to erroneous results. Therefore, alternative assay procedures are required to assess accurately the drug content. Two such methods are described. The first is the acid-dye type and involves the partitioning of a trifluoperazinebromocresol purple complex between an aqueous buffer pH 6 and benzene containing 1 2 isoamyl alcohol and subsequent measurement of the yellow-colored organic phase at 410 mp. Acidic and neutral compounds as well as the common excipients do not interfere. The second method employs an alkaline siliceousearth column through which the drug is eluted into a chloroform-methanolHCI system and the absorbance measured at 259 mp. The precision and accuracy of the alternative methods, as well as the pharmacopeial procedure are compared using commercial dosage forms and simulated drug-excipient mixtures.},

Such a source, as well as the EUVL tool, has to fulﬁl very high demands both technical and cost oriented. The EUVL tool operates at a wavelength of 13.5 nm, which requires the following new developments. • The light production mechanism changes from conventional lamps and lasers to relatively high-temperature emitting plasmas. • The light transport, mainly refractive for deep ultraviolet (DUV), should be reﬂective for EUV. • The source speciﬁcations as derived from the customer requirements on wafer throughput mean that the output EUV source power has to be hundreds of watts. This in its turn means that tens to hundreds of kilowatts of dissipated power has to be managed in a relatively small volume. • In order to keep lithography costs as low as possible, the lifetime of the components should be as long as possible and at least of the order of thousands of hours. This poses a challenge for the sources, namely how to design and manufacture components robust enough to withstand the intense environment of high heat dissipation, ﬂows of several keV ions as well as the atomic and particular debris within the source vessel. • As with all lithography tools, the imaging requirements demand a narrow illumination bandwidth. Absorption of materials at EUV wavelengths is extreme with extinguishing lengths of the order of tens of nanometres, so the balance between high transmission and spectral purity requires careful engineering. All together, EUV lithography sources present technological challenges in various ﬁelds of physics such as plasma, optics and material science. These challenges are being tackled by the source manufacturers and investigated extensively in the research facilities around the world. An overview of the published results on the topic as well as the analyses of the physical processes behind the proposed solutions will be presented in this paper.},

Both methods show that micelles are formed in N-methyl acetamide solution in the presence of n-alkanols. Critical micelle concentration has been determined for each of the surfactants. Critical micelle concentrations have also been measured as a function of the concentration of alcohol added. It is suggested that alcohol addition leads to an increase in N-methyl acetamide penetration into the micellar interface that depends on the alcohol chain length.

	abstract = {The development of affordable Internet-based tools and platforms has led to major transformations in organizational dynamics. One key change is the shift of agency from center to ends and the consequent emergence of decentralized (networked) organizations. Focusing on the realm of collective action, we suggest that organizational conﬁgurations constructed around participants with greater agency induce organizations to promote new ﬁltering tactics to sort out members who are valuable to the group. Drawing on Signaling Theory, we analyze the ﬁltering behavior that organizations develop in their attempt to cope effectively with a type of tension characteristic of the digital era: The impetus to uphold egalitarian ideals on the one hand and the need to sort out desired participants on the other. Previous studies have explained how boundary work actually works in bureaucratic settings with fairly clear boundaries. This study focused instead on how new patterns of collective participation emerge, and how novel practices related to ﬁltering are distributed in decentralized organizations. The study makes two points with theoretical implications. First, it explains an organization’s decision to conduct ﬁltering measures – a decision that on the face of it is counterintuitive since organizations operating in a digital environment can tolerate the enclosure of ‘free riders’. The second point relates to ﬁltering practices. It shows that the emergence of new forms of participation, practices and norm, due to the development of networked media, encourages creativity in the development of speciﬁc ﬁltering tactics, with activists considering new tactics for achieving their goals.},

Such a source, as well as the EUVL tool, has to fulﬁl extremely high demands both technical and cost oriented. The EUVL tool operates at a wavelength in the range 13–14 nm, which requires a major re-thinking of state-of-the-art lithography systems operating in the DUV range. The light production mechanism changes from conventional lamps and lasers to relatively high temperature emitting plasmas. The light transport, mainly refractive for DUV, should become reﬂective for EUV. The source speciﬁcations are derived from the customer requirements for the complete tool, which are: throughput, cost of ownership (CoO) and imaging quality. The EUVL system is considered as a follow up of the existing DUV based lithography technology and, while improving the feature resolution, it has to maintain high wafer throughput performance, which is driven by the overall CoO picture. This in turn puts quite high requirements on the collectable in-band power produced by an EUV source. Increased, due to improved feature resolution, critical dimension (CD) control requirements, together with reﬂective optics restrictions, necessitate pulse-to-pulse repeatability, spatial stability control and repetition rates, which are substantially better than those of current optical systems. All together the following aspects of the source speciﬁcation will be addressed: the operating wavelength, the EUV power, the hot spot size, the collectable angle, the repetition rate, the pulse-to-pulse repeatability and the debris induced lifetime of components.},

The SBH distributions for the mixed interfaces are about four times broader than the pure gold interface and have a complex structure arising from the incomplete intermixing and its eﬀects on the scattering of hot electrons. The maps of the barrier heights and amplitudes for the mixed samples are inhomogeneous with localization attributed to the disordered mixture of the Au and Ag. A method to calculate ratio of the Au to Ag Schottky barrier heights is presented and discussed in relationship to the interface composition. These results demonstrate how the Schottky barrier height is a function of position at the interface and how mapping can capture the electrostatic nature of these and possibly other mixed metal-semiconductor interfaces.},

This process combines ubiquitous photopatterning techniques with simple solution processing to yield highly selective and densely packed carbon nanotube patterns. The key mechanism is the change in surface chemistry caused by the UV-induced monolayer reaction. Selective deposition of carbon nanotubes was achieved by drop-casting the CNT solution onto the photopatterned substrates where the CNT solution only wets the exposed areas. Several compounds were employed, each with unique end groups that yield a range of surface energies. The selectivity is dependent on the contrast in the surface wettability. Increased selectivity was achieved by tuning the surface energy with addition of alcohol or a nonionic surfactant.},

And, the other way around, for a given content, e.g. a YouTube video, is it possible to predict its political audience? To address this latter question, we present a large scale study of anonymous YouTube video consumption of politicized users, where political orientation is derived from visits to “beacon pages”, namely, political partisan blogs. Though our techniques are relevant for targeted political advertising, we believe that our ﬁndings are also of a wider interest.},

A maximum conversion efficiency of 4.5\% was measured for a CO2 laser driven Sn plasma having a narrow spectrum at 13.5 nm. In addition, low debris generation was observed. The CO2 MOPA laser system is based on commercial high power cw CO2 lasers. We achieve an average laser power of 6 kW at 100 kHz with a single laser beam that has very good beam quality. In a first step, a 50-W light source is developing. Based on a 10-kW CO2 laser this light source is scalable to more than 100 W EUV in-band power.},

	abstract = {Phase-space optics allows the simultaneous visualization of both space (x) and spatial frequency (k) information. Previous experiments have focused mainly on coherent beams, which are fully described by a two-dimensional complex field (amplitude and phase). In contrast, partially coherent beams inherently have more degrees of freedom and require a four-dimensional description. This description is particularly important for propagation, in which coherence properties determine the intensity evolution. Despite this, most measurements in linear optics, and all those in nonlinear optics, have recorded only the intensity and power spectrum projections (x-space or k-space only). Measuring local coherence remains a challenging problem, especially in the full four-dimensional phase space. In turn, the recording difficulty has limited efforts to generate arbitrary, spatially varying patterns of coherence, despite their usefulness for imaging, illumination and display. We remedy both problems here, using spatial light modulators to create beams with locally varying spatial coherence and to measure their phase-space properties.},

by the EUV Limited Liability Company, a consortium formed by Intel and
supported by Motorola and AMD to perform R and D work at three national
laboratories. Much work has already taken place, with the first
prototypical cameras operational at 13.4 nm using low energy laser
plasma EUV light sources to investigate issues including the source,
camera, electro- mechanical and system issues, photoresists, and of
course the masks. EUV lithograph masks are fundamentally different than
conventional photolithographic masks as they are reflective instead of
transmissive. EUV light at 13.4 nm is rapidly absorbed by most
materials, thus all light transmission within the EUVL system from
source to silicon wafer, including EUV reflected from the mask, is
performed by multilayer mirrors in vacuum.},

The key relation obtained from this analysis is a closed-form expression for the ﬁlter function in terms of the desired output spectral degree of coherence. This theory is veriﬁed with Monte Carlo wave-optics simulations of spatial coherence control and beam shaping for potential use in free-space optical communications and directed energy applications. The simulated results are found to be in good agreement with the developed theory. The technique presented in this paper will be useful in applications where coherence control is advantageous, e.g., directed energy, free-space optical communications, remote sensing, medicine, and manufacturing.},

	abstract = {We present spatial coherence measurements of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light generated through the process of high-harmonic up-conversion of a femtosecond laser. With a phase-matched hollow-fiber geometry, the generated beam was found to exhibit essentially full spatial coherence. The coherence of this laser-like EUV source was shown by recording Gabor holograms of small objects. This work demonstrates the capability to perform EUV holography with a tabletop experimental setup. Such an EUV source, with low divergence and high spatial coherence, can be used for experiments involving high-precision metrology, inspection of optical components for EUV lithography, and microscopy and holography with nanometer resolution. Furthermore, the short time duration of the EUV radiation (a few femtoseconds) will enable EUV microscopy and holography to be performed with ultrahigh time resolution.},

	abstract = {An approximate method is proposed to calculate the EUV scattering from a defect within a multilayer coating. In this single surface approximation (SSA) the defective multilayer structure is replaced by a single reflecting surface with the shape of the top surface of the multilayer. The range of validity of this approximation has been investigated for Gaussian line defects using 2D finite-difference-time-domain simulations. The SSA is found to be valid for sufficiently low aspect ratio defects such as those expected for the critical defects nucleated by particles on the mask substrate. The critical EUVL defect size is calculated by combining the SSA with a multilayer growth model and aerial image simulations. Another approximate method for calculating the aerial image of an unresolved defect is also discussed. Although the critical substrate defects may be larger than the resolution of higher NA cameras, the point defect approximation provides a useful framework for understanding the printability of a wide range of defects.},

The work has been conducted using ﬁrst-principles calculations based on density-functional theory under the local-density approximation. Particular emphasis is placed upon two currently problematic aspects of doping diamond: the lack of a suitable shallow donor impurity for n-type doping of the bulk, and the need for a stable adsorbate material for p-type doping of the diamond surface (transfer doping). Since the latter clearly requires an understanding of the properties of the various diamond surfaces, the effects of atomic geometry and surface termination on the electronic structure of the technologically important diamond surfaces have also been investigated.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a theory of transverse coherence properties of Undulator Radiation. Our study is of very practical relevance, because it yields specific predictions of Undulator Radiation cross-spectral density in various parts of the beamline. On the contrary, usual estimations of coherence properties assume that the undulator source is quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely on the application of van Cittert-Zernike (VCZ) theorem, in its original or generalized form, for calculating transverse coherence length in the far-field approximation. The VCZ theorem is derived in the frame of Statistical Optics using a number of restrictive assumptions: in particular, the quasi-homogeneous assumption is demonstrated to be inaccurate in many practical situations regarding undulator sources. We propose a technique to calculate the cross-spectral density from undulator sources in the most general case. Also, we find the region of applicability of the quasi-homogeneous model and we present an analytical expression for the cross-spectral density which is valid up to the exit of the undulator. For the case of more general undulator sources, simple formulas for the transverse coherence length, interpolated from numerical calculations and suitable for beamline design applications are found. Finally, using a simple vertical slit, we show how transverse coherence properties of an X-ray beam can be manipulated to obtain a larger coherent spot-size on a sample. This invention was devised almost entirely on the basis of theoretical ideas developed throughout this paper.},

	abstract = {Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is seen as a main candidate for production of future generation computer technology. Due to the short wavelength of EUV light (around 13 nm) novel reflective masks have to be used in the production process. A prerequisite to meet the high quality requirements for these EUV masks is a simple and accurate method for absorber pattern profile characterization. In our previous work we demonstrated that the Finite Element Method (FEM) is very well suited for the simulation of EUV scatterometry and can be used to reconstruct EUV mask profiles from experimental scatterometric data. In this contribution we apply an indirect metrology method to periodic EUV line masks with different critical dimensions (140 nm and 540 nm) over a large range of duty cycles (1:2, ..., 1:20). We quantitatively compare the reconstructed absorber pattern parameters to values obtained from direct AFM and CD-SEM measurements. We analyze the reliability of the reconstruction for the given experimental data. For the CD of the absorber lines, the comparison shows agreement of the order of 1nm. Furthermore we discuss special numerical techniques like domain decomposition algorithms and high order finite elements and their importance for fast and accurate solution of the inverse problem.},

In a plasma generated by tin oxide, number density of tin becomes one half of that by tin if the electron density profile is assumed to be the same. As a result, absorption of 13.5 nm emission at low density corona region is suppressed and higher conversion efficiency is obtained. From this discussion, more efficient targets for longer pulse YAG laser is proposed.},

The radius of coherence of {\textasciitilde}60 μm was estimated at the distance of 2.1 m from the source. The number of coherently emitted photons was sufficient to demonstrate coherent imaging. Using partially coherent radiation from such source Gabor EUV holography was successfully demonstrated.},

Then, the brightness includes information on both coherence and wavefront characteristics of the radiation field. For undulator sources, it is customary to approximate the single-electron electric field at resonance with a Gaussian beam, leading to great simplifications. Attempts to account for the modified spatial and angular profile of the undulator radiation in the presence of detuning due to energy spread, currently build on the simplified brightness expression derived under the assumption of Gaussian beams. The influence of energy spread on undulator radiation properties is becoming important in view of diffraction-limited rings with ultralow emittance coming on-line. Here the effects of energy spread on the brightness of undulator radiation at resonance are discussed, as well as relevant relations with coherence properties.},

A review of the properties of undulator radiation is presented, followed by a discussion of some of the unique challenges being faced by the builders and users of the new undulator sources. These include difficult mechanical and magnetic tolerance limits, a complex interaction with the storage ring, high x-ray beam power, partial coherence, harmonics, optics contamination, and the unusual spectral and angular properties of undulator radiation.},

The source of choice will be a Sn liquid droplet source, ideally operating at a 100 kHz repetition rate preionised by a low intensity Nd:YAG prepulse and allowed to expand until it reaches the critical density for CO2 radaiton when it will be reheated by a CO2 pulse. The challenges here are tailoring the duration of the CO2 pulse to match the lifetime of the plasma target when it is at the optimum density for absorption of the 10.6 µm radiation and sustaining the high required repetition rate for both stable droplet injection and laser operation. For 6.x nm based sources a major increase in CE needs to be attained in order to demonstrate the feasibility of that technology as well as the experimental realisation of the theoretical mirror reflectivitis for the LaB4C multilayers. Even then, the design of a droplet injection system will pose a major additional challenge. Should all these difficulties be overcome the power requirement at intermediate focus will probably exceed 1KW because of the increased resolution required on the resist.},

Three major challenges are to be mentioned in the development of tools: (i) scaling-down, (ii) improvement of duty cycle, and (iii) reduction of costs. Directly or indirectly, each of such efforts can take full advantage of light sources with shorter and shorter wavelength, especially if these are laboratory-scale facilities. Short wavelength light permits both the manufacturing and inspection at reduced length scales, thus downsizing the integrated circuits. In practice, a new technology becomes enabling only if it manages to pass through alpha and beta testing in due time. In fact, tool manufacturers go through two lengthy stages of testing before release. The first stage, or alpha testing, is often performed only by users within a developing company. The second stage, or beta testing, involves a selected number of external users. These scheduled procedures permit that forthcoming needs are identified and addressed well in advance. In conclusion, it is the technologies under today's research development that are the only option for tomorrow's industry.},

Programmed pit defect shows that minimum printable size of pits could be 17 nm of SEVD from the AIT. However 23.1nm in SEVD is printable from the EUV ADT. Defect printability and identification of its source along from blank fabrication to mask fabrication were studied using various inspection tools.

Nevertheless, there are several areas where improvement in this lithographic technology would be very beneficial, most notably exposure tool reliability (particularly the light source) and mask contamination. These areas have important consequences for productivity. Future generations of EUV lithography are expected, but there are several challenges to be overcome, particularly in the areas of resists and computational lithography. A replacement for chemically amplified resists may be required. Regardless of resist type, exposure doses must be sufficiently high to prevent photon shot noise from causing high levels of yield loss. Computational lithography for next generation EUV lithography will be very complex.},

Temporal coherence is related to the intrinsic spectrum bandwidth of the light source, while spatial coherence can be affected by the size of the light source and propagation distance in use. These two coherence properties are measured for various light sources of diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser, laser diode (LD), light emitting diode (LED), super luminescent light emitting diode (sLED) and micro light emitting diode (mLED) in different settings, together with the quality of the holographic reconstructed images. Although the image sharpness and speckle are related to both coherence parameters, our results and subsequent analysis show that the spatial coherence can be linked directly to the image sharpness and the temporal coherence to the speckle. This will provide a quantitative way not only to optimize the image quality between uniformity and sharpness but also to determine the safety power level for different light sources when viewing the produced images by human eyes directly.},

We have developed using the wavefront propagation code Synchrotron Radiation Workshop (SRW) running in a Python environment, a parallel computer program using the Monte Carlo method for modelling the partially coherent emission from electron beam sources taking into account the  nite emittance of the source. Using a parallel computing cluster with in excess of 500 cores and each core calculating the wavefront from in excess of a 1000 electrons, a source containing millions of electrons could be simulated.

Two exercises are important in this analysis of an archaeological genealogical perspective: on the one hand, it comprehends the impact which self-help has in the life of its readers and practitioners, allowing the consolidation and broad diffusion of tools to guide one’s own life and define modes of being within the world; on the other hand, thinking that the techniques provided by self-help may proceed in a millenary tradition of practices intended for the government itself. The study of the series self-help—education—government allows some of the main elements of these discourses to be identified and shows the centrality of the notion of learning among them.},

Based on the results of a survey developed to measure the readiness of faculty and staff to adopt OER, this paper focuses on the measurement of OER use and creation, and identifies factors to increase both. The survey was administered in September 2012 to faculty and staff of Athabasca University, Canada’s open university. The results offer a snapshot of OER use and creation at one university. The survey tool could provide a mechanism to compare and contrast OER adoption with other higher education institutions. Forty-three percent of those in the sample are using OER and 31\% are creating OER. This ratio of use to creation is introduced as a possible metric to measure adoption.},

These resist structures can be transferred into the underlying materials using plasma etch techniques to a similar degree of resolution. The density of resist features is also greater than for positive PMMA with features of ∼15 nm in width being possible on a 30 nm pitch.

	abstract = {The spectral properties of La/B, La/B4C, and LaN/B, LaN/B4C multilayer mirrors have been investigated in the 6.5-6.9 nm wavelength range based on measured B and B4C optical constants. Experimentally it is verified to what extent measured and tabulated optical constants are applicable for simulations of the reflectivity of these short period multilayer mirrors. The measured maximum reflectance at various wavelength values around the boron-K absorption edge is compared to calculated values from model systems. The measured reflectance profiles of La/B and La/B4C show a maximum at a slightly larger wavelength than calculations would predict based on the measured B and B4C optical constants. This is explained by the influence of a formed boron-lanthanum compound on the wavelength where the multilayer shows maximum reflectance. The maximum reflectance profiles of LaN/B and LaN/B4C multilayers can be described accurately by using the same boron atomic scattering factors, indicating boron in the LaN/B4C multilayer to be in a similar chemical state as boron in the LaN/B multilayer. It also indicates that nitridation of the La layer in the multilayer prevents the formation of La-B compounds. We show that the optimal wavelength for boron based optics is about 6.65 nm and depends on the B chemical state. Finally, using the measured B optical constants we are able to calculate the spectral response of the multilayers, enabling the prediction of the optimal parameters for the above mentioned multilayers ©2012 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (340.7480) X-rays, soft x-rays, extreme ultraviolet (EUV); (340.7470) X-ray mirrors.},

In this work, HSQ has been investigated for its applicability in photon-based lithographies. No measurable sensitivity has been observed for wavelengths of 800–400, 365, 248 and 193 nm. For 157 nm wavelength, negative tone behaviour starts at 650 mJ / cm2 and for 13.5 nm (EUV) at 50 mJ / cm2. For 1.3 nm wavelength (X-ray lithography), the negative tone behaviour starts from around 400 mJ / cm2, indicating that HSQ is 2.5 times more sensitive than positive tone PMMA.

We analyze popularity in a comprehensive fashion by looking at properties and patterns in time and considering various popularity metrics. We further study the relationship of the popularity metrics and we ﬁnd that four of them are highly correlated (viewcount, \#comments, \#ratings, \#favorites) while the ﬁfth one, the average rating, exhibits very little correlation with the other metrics. We also ﬁnd a “magic number” in the average behavior of videos: for every 400 times a video is viewed, we have one of each of the following user actions: leaving a comment, rating the video and adding to one’s favorite set.},

The major issue for the 22-nm half-pitch node remains simultaneously meeting resolution, line-edge roughness (LER), and sensitivity requirements. Although several materials have met the resolution requirements, LER and sensitivity remain a challenge. As we move beyond the 22-nm node, however, even resolution remains a significant challenge. Chemically amplified resists have yet to demonstrate the required resolution at any speed or LER for 16-nm half pitch and below. Going to non-chemically amplified resists, however, 16-nm resolution has been achieved with a LER of 2 nm but a sensitivity of only 70 mJ/cm2.},

	abstract = {Recently, while performing extensive EUV irradiation endurance testing on Ru-capped multilayer mirrors in the presence of elevated partial pressures of water and hydrocarbons, NIST has observed that the amount of EUV-induced damage actually decreases with increasing levels of water vapor above {\textasciitilde}5x10-7 Torr. It is thought that the admitted water vapor may interact with otherwise stable, condensed carbonaceous species in an UHV vacuum system to increase the background levels of simple gaseous carbon-containing molecules. Some support for this hypothesis was demonstrated by observing the mitigating effect of very small levels of simple hydrocarbons with the intentional introduction of methyl alcohol in addition to the water vapor. It was found that the damage rate decreased by at least an order of magnitude when the partial pressure of methyl alcohol was just one percent of the water partial pressure. These observations indicate that the hydrocarbon components of the vacuum environment under actual testing conditions must be characterized and controlled to 10-11 Torr or better in order to quantify the damage caused by high levels of water vapor. The possible effects of exposure beam size and out-of-band radiation on mirror lifetime testing will also be discussed.},

The usual approaches to obtaining elemental contrast involve measurement of the characteristic peaks associated with x-ray fluorescence or measuring the x-ray transmission as a function of energy. In the laboratory these measurements are challenging due to the polychromaticity and lack of tunability of the source. Here we demonstrate how newly developed, high-resolution, energy-discriminating area detector technology can be exploited to enhance elemental contrast. The detector we employ here is the Pixirad area detector which can simultaneously have up to four separate colour channels. We also discuss the potential of this new technology in the context of tomographic imaging of soft tissue.},

The edge quality is improved by anti-reﬂective coating (ARC) between the substrate and the photoresist to minimize the interference of vertical standing waves. Using AZ-BARLi-II 90 (ARC), 100 nm uniform dot pattern with smooth and round edge quality is demonstrated. Three regions of laser intensity distributions and vertical standing wave schematics are described.

In this paper, we present new techniques for measuring high-latitude HF communications link parameters using data from SuperDARN radars. These techniques use ground-scatter returns to deﬁne the variation in skip distance with frequency. From these data, the maximum usable frequency (MUF) as a function of range is determined and ionospheric critical frequencies are estimated. These calculations are made in near-real-time and the results are made available on the World Wide Web. F-region critical frequencies calculated using this method show good agreement with ionosonde data.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method to improve the alignment accuracy of a mask in linear scale projection lithography, in which the adjacent pixel gray square variance method is applied to a charge-coupled device (CCD) image to obtain the best position of the focal length of the motherboard and then realize the alignment of the focal plane. Two image positions in the focal plane of the CCD are compared with the traits overlap according to the image splicing principle, and four typical errors are corrected on the basis of the total grating errors. Simultaneously, the rotation error of the mask is used to summarize the grayscale variation function of the CCD image. Threshold functions are employed to express the factors including the wave crests of the amplitude, period error, and phase error, which govern the rotation accuracy and weight alignment accuracy expression of the established four error factors. Finally, in the experiment, the slope of the mask is corrected and adjusted to the same direction as the slide plate with the assistance of a dual-frequency laser interferometer. The effect of the alignment error on the lithography accuracy is discussed and veriﬁed in the static case, and it is found that the CCD maximum resolution pixel is 0.1 µm and accuracy of the scale is 0.79 µm in only a 200-mm-measurement range.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the role of the crossover operator in genetic algorithms. Speciﬁcally, we study optimisation problems that exhibit many local optima and consider how crossover affects the rate at which the population breaks the symmetry of the problem. As an example of such a problem, we consider the subset sum problem. In doing so, we demonstrate a previously unobserved phenomenon, whereby the genetic algorithm with crossover exhibits a critical mutation rate, at which its performance sharply diverges from that of the genetic algorithm without crossover. At this critical mutation rate, the genetic algorithm with crossover exhibits a rapid increase in population diversity. We calculate the details of this phenomenon on a simple instance of the subset sum problem and show that it is a classic phase transition between ordered and disordered populations. Finally, we show that this critical mutation rate corresponds to the transition between the genetic algorithm accelerating or preventing symmetry breaking and that the critical mutation rate represents an optimum in terms of the balance of exploration and exploitation within the algorithm.},

The focus on curiosity as individual differences variable was motivated by the importance of curiosity in science education, and uncertainty being central to both the definition of curiosity and the inquirylearning environment. Curiosity was assessed with the Underwater Exploration game (Jirout, J., \& Klahr, D. (2012). Children’s scientific curiosity: In search of an operational definition of an elusive concept. Developmental Review, 32, 125–160. doi:10.1016/j.dr.2012.04.002), and inquiry-based learning with the newly developed Scientific Discovery task, which focuses on the principle of designing informative experiments. Structure of the inquiry-learning environment was manipulated by explaining this principle or not. As intelligence relates to learning and possibly curiosity, it was taken into account. Results showed that children’s curiosity was positively related to their knowledge acquisition, but not to their quality of exploration. For low intelligent children, environment structure positively affected their quality of exploration, but not their knowledge acquisition. There was no interaction between curiosity and environment structure. These results support the existence of two distinct inquiry-based learning processes – the designing of experiments, on the one hand, and the reflection on performed experiments, on the other – and link children’s curiosity to the latter process.},

Such a paradigm has been proved promising for a wide range of applications from nanoelectronics to optoelectronics and spintronics. Here, using ﬁrst-principles calculations, we investigate the electronic structure and interface characteristics of a newly synthesized GaSe/graphene (GaSe/g) vdW heterostructure. We show that the intrinsic electronic properties of GaSe and graphene are both well preserved in the heterostructure, with a Schottky barrier formed at the GaSe/g interface. More interestingly, the band alignment between graphene and GaSe can be effectively modulated by tuning the interfacial distance or applying an external electric ﬁled. This makes the Schottky barrier height (SBH) controllable, which is highly desirable in the electronic and optoelectronic devices based on vdW heterostructures. In particular, the tunability of the interface dipole and potential step is further uncovered to be the underlying mechanism that ensures this controllable tuning of SBH.},

A statistical model is built up based on the lithography imaging model to characterize the information transfer between the mask and print images. Then, this paper calculates the optimal information transfer (OIT) in partially coherent lithography systems, and derives the theoretical limit of image ﬁdelity for optical proximity correction (OPC), which is used extensively in computational lithography. Finally, the proposed information theoretical approaches are applied to improve the OPC solutions obtained by the gradient-based algorithm.

	abstract = {Advances in computational lithography over the last 10 years have been instrumental to the continued scaling of semiconductor devices. Competitive scaling requires two types of complementary models: fast predictive empirical models that can be used for pattern correction and verification; rigorous physical models that can be used to identify key physical effects that must be considered to ensure pattern fidelity, but are too resource intensive to use for full chip applications. Today, all computational lithography efforts such as the optical proximity correction (OPC) and the optical rules check (ORC) depend on the ability to predictively model the lithography and metrology processes. We discuss some of the current modeling practices in optics, mask, resist and etching, leading to the “Holy Grail” of predictively modeling entire patterning process which we call “virtual fab”. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) modeling is discussed due to its potential to extend optical lithography scaling for future nodes. Modeling of novel technologies such as Diblock Copolymer patterning is also discussed to demonstrate new opportunities for continued scaling. Complexity of the “virtual fab” approach is extremely high as there are multiple dimensions in this approach. The need to overcome this complexity, by reducing the number of dimensions of the problem, is evident. Lastly, the ability to leverage lithography modeling in design co-optimization is an important element of semiconductor device scaling.},

	abstract = {Lithography tools are being built and shipped to semiconductor manufacturers for high volume manufacturing using extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) at a wavelength of 13.5 nm. This wavelength is based on the availability of Mo/Si multilayer mirrors (MLMs) with a reﬂectivity of ∼70\% at this wavelength. Moreover, the primary lithography tool manufacturer, ASML, has identiﬁed 6.x nm, where x∼7, as the wavelength of choice for so-called Beyond EUVL, based on the availability of La/B4C MLMs, with theoretical reﬂectance approaching 80\% at this wavelength. The optimum sources have been identiﬁed as laser produced plasmas of Gd and Tb, as n = 4–n = 4 transitions in their ions emit strongly near this wavelength. However, to date, the highest conversion efﬁciency obtained, for laser to EUV energy emitted within the 0.6\% wavelength bandwidth of the mirror is only 0.8\%, pointing to the need to identify other potential sources or consider the selection of other wavelengths. At the same time, sources for other applications are being developed. Conventional sources for soft x-ray microscopy use H-like line emission from liquid nitrogen or carbon containing liquid jets which can be focused using zone plates. Recently the possibility of using MLMs with n = 4−n = 4 emission from a highly charged Bi plasma was proposed and subsequently the possibility of using Δn = 1 transitions in 3rd row transition elements was identiﬁed. All of these studies seek to identify spectral features that coincide with the reﬂectance characteristics of available MLMs, determine the conditions under which they are optimized and establish the maximum conversion efﬁciencies obtainable. Thus, there is a need for systematic studies of laser produced plasmas of a wide range of elements as some of the challenges are similar for all of these sources and some recent results will be presented.},

Yet, instead of a fully informed and deliberative public, past research indicates that it is more likely that the public by nature is ‘miserly’, with individuals relying on their value predispositions and only the information most readily available to them from the mass media and other sources in order to formulate an opinion about science controversy. Building on this latter ‘accessibility’ or ‘memorybased’ model of opinion formation, this study tests the relationship between an increase in available information—or increasing ‘awareness’—and public support for embryonic stem cell research. An analysis of national survey data collected in the USA during the fall of  and the fall of  indicates that although an increase in awareness leads to an increase in support for research, both religious and ideological value predispositions strongly moderate the impact of awareness.},

Increasingly, however, consumers are utilizing platforms–—such as content sharing sites, blogs, social networking, and wikis–—to create, modify, share, and discuss Internet content. This represents the social media phenomenon, which can now signiﬁcantly impact a ﬁrm’s reputation, sales, and even survival. Yet, many executives eschew or ignore this form of media because they don’t understand what it is, the various forms it can take, and how to engage with it and learn. In response, we present a framework that deﬁnes social media by using seven functional building blocks: identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. As different social media activities are deﬁned by the extent to which they focus on some or all of these blocks, we explain the implications that each block can have for how ﬁrms should engage with social media. To conclude, we present a number of recommendations regarding how ﬁrms should develop strategies for monitoring, understanding, and responding to different social media activities.},

In parallel, EUV interference lithography based on interference transmission gratings has emerged as a powerful tool for industrial and academic research. In this paper, we demonstrate nanopatterning with sub-10 nm resolution using this technique. Highly efﬁcient and optimized molybdenum gratings result in resolved line/space patterns down to 8 nm half-pitch and show modulation down to 6 nm half-pitch. These results show the performance of optical nanopatterning in the sub-10 nm range and currently mark the record for photon-based lithography. Moreover, an efﬁcient phase mask completely suppressing the zeroth-order diffraction and providing 50 nm line/space patterns over large areas is evaluated. Such efﬁcient phase masks pave the way towards table-top EUV interference lithography systems.},

The strongest lines result from 4d–4f lines in the spectra of Ag-like Gd XVIII and Tb XIX through Rh-like Gd XX and Tb XXI. Assuming collisional radiative equilibrium, the optimum plasma temperature for producing these species is expected to be in the range 100–130 eV. Time integrated experimental spectra have been recorded with a variety of lasers and a maximum measured conversion efﬁciency (CE) for 150 ps pulses was 0.4\%. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission was observed to be anisotropic while the ion energy decreases with decreasing pulse length. The optimum laser intensity for efﬁcient 6.7 nm EUV emission was determined to be close to 7 × 1013 W cm−2, which gives an electron temperature of ∼130 eV. The use of prepulses increases the CE which is limited by plasma opacity. To improve radiation transport low initial density targets and/or low electron density plasmas such as CO2 LPPs are required.},

The focus of this article is on platinum because it is the most used electrode metal for devices in commercial use. The i(Ve) proﬁle or cyclic voltammogram contains information about electron transfer processes that can occur when the electrode-electrolyte interface, Ve, is at a speciﬁc potential, and assumed to be near steady-state conditions. For the engineer/designer this means that if the potential is not in the range of a speciﬁc electron transfer process, that process cannot occur. An i(Ve) proﬁle, recorded at sweep rates greater than 0.1 mVs−1, approximates steady-state conditions. Rapid transient potential excursions, like that seen with neural stimulation pulses, may be too fast for the reaction to occur, however, this means that if the potential is in the range of a speciﬁc electron transfer process it may occur and should be considered. The approach described here can be used to describe the thermodynamic electron transfer processes on other candidate electrode metals, e.g. stainless steel, iridium, carbon-based, etc.},

	abstract = {Multilayers, which consist of periodic/aperiodic nanometer-scale stacks of two or more alternating materials, fill a gap between visible light optics and natural crystal by realizing high near-normal incidence reflectivity in extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray regions and diffraction-limited focusing in hard X-ray region. Before fabricating a multilayer, it is essential to design a structure that realizes the required optical features. The optimization process uses merit functions that are defined by the design targets. In this chapter, the designs of two typical aperiodic multilayer structure, X-ray supermirror and EUV beam splitter, are introduced. Precision characterization of multilayer structures is the key process in multilayer sciences as well in order to improve fabricating process and determine optical properties in use. Searching a most suitable structure model to approaching real one by comparing experimental and simulated results is essentially an optimization problem. In this chapter, by fitting the X-ray grazing incidence reflectivity and diffuse scattering curves, the realistic multilayer structures are determined accurately.},

(For a binary representation, the Walsh transform is the Fourier transform.) The results are of a theoretical nature and are based on the analysis of mutation and crossover. The Fourier transform of the mixing matrix is shown to be sparse. An explicit formula is given for the spectrum of the diﬀerential of the mixing transformation. By using the Fourier representation and the fast Fourier transform, one generation of the inﬁnite population simple genetic algorithm can be computed in time O(cℓ log2 3), where c is arity of the alphabet and ℓ is the string length. This is in contrast to the time of O(c3ℓ) for the algorithm as represented in the standard basis. There are two orthogonal decompositions of population space which are invariant under mixing. The sequel to this paper will apply the basic theoretical results obtained here to inverse problems and asymptotic behavior.},

As recently demonstrated, phase-contrast imaging is characterized by its extraordinary image quality, greatly enhanced contrast, and good soft tissue discrimination with very high spatial resolution down to the micron and even the sub-micron region. The rapid development of compact X-ray sources of high brightness, tuneability, and monochromaticity as well as high-resolution X-ray detectors with high quantum efﬁciency and improved computational methods is stimulating the development of a new generation of X-ray imaging systems for medical applications. The present paper reviews some intrinsic mechanisms, recent technical developments and potential medical applications of two-, three- and four-dimensional phase-contrast X-ray imaging. Challenging issues in current phase-contrast imaging techniques and key clinical applications are discussed and possible developments of future high-contrast and high spatial and temporal resolution medical X-ray imaging systems are outlined.},

	abstract = {The estimation of the impact of surface roughness on the light scattering losses and the scattering distribution is of crucial importance for deriving roughness specifications for optical surfaces. A detailed roughness analysis should always be based on surface Power Spectral Density functions and the band-limited roughness relevant for the application at hand. The scattering from single surfaces can easily be estimated using rather simple formulas. The most commonly used expression to estimate the total scattering, however, is only valid if the roughness is small and the correlation width is large compared to the wavelength of light. A special expression has been used in the thin film community for surface structures with short correlation lengths. It will be demonstrated that distinguishing between these limiting cases is unnecessary simply by using the concept of band-limited roughness. Different models are compared to results of scatter measurements and discussed with respect to their ranges of validity.},

Thereafter a genetic algorithm based clustering technique which uses this point symmetry based distance (GASDCA) is developed. GASDCA is therefore able to detect both convex and non-convex clusters. Kd-tree based nearest neighbor search is used to reduce the complexity of ﬁnding the closest symmetric point. The proposed GASDCA is compared with existing symmetry based clustering technique, SBKM, its modiﬁed version, Mod-SBKM and the well-known K-means algorithm. Results on several data sets show the effectiveness of GASDCA.},

Definitions and guidelines in respect of social media metrics are mentioned in this chapter. Further it suggests the methods in choosing the right metrics for the key social media objectives in respect of canvassing or product launches. A new Social media metrics framework has been suggested and also the metrics have been identified for each framework group. This Chapter will help Organizations in identifying the key social media metrics for tracking and monitoring the measurement of the performance of one’s brands, products, and services in the social media channels. Once the key social media metrics are identified, organizations can choose the right tool to measure the metrics defined. This would help Organizations to improve or enhance their marketing and operational business strategies by leveraging the power and reach of the social media channels. The future directions for research and the references indicated in this chapter would be of great help to researchers in the area of social media metrics.},

The performances of two different computational lithography solutions, idealized un-constrained ILT mask and manhattanized mask rule constrain (MRC) compliant mask, are compared. Additionally performance benefits for process-window aware hybrid assist feature (AF) are gauged against traditional rule-based AF. The results of this study will demonstrate the lithographic performance contribution that can be obtained from these mask optimization techniques in addition to what source optimization can achieve.},

YouTube has a great impact on Internet trafﬁc nowadays, yet itself is suffering from a severe problem of scalability. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of YouTube and similar sites is essential to network trafﬁc engineering and to their sustainable development. To this end, we have crawled the YouTube site for four months, collecting more than 3 million YouTube videos’ data. In this paper, we present a systematic and in-depth measurement study on the statistics of YouTube videos. We have found that YouTube videos have noticeably different statistics compared to traditional streaming videos, ranging from length and access pattern, to their growth trend and active life span. We investigate the social networking in YouTube videos, as this is a key driving force toward its success. In particular, we ﬁnd that the links to related videos generated by uploaders’ choices have clear small-world characteristics. This indicates that the videos have strong correlations with each other, and creates opportunities for developing novel techniques to enhance the service quality.},

	abstract = {When light hits a multilayer planar stack, it is reﬂected, refracted, and absorbed in a way that can be derived from the Fresnel equations. The analysis is treated in many textbooks, and implemented in many software programs, but certain aspects of it are diﬃcult to ﬁnd explicitly and consistently worked out in the literature. Here, we derive the formulas underlying the transfer-matrix method of calculating the optical properties of these stacks, including oblique-angle incidence, absorption-vs-position proﬁles, and ellipsometry parameters. We discuss and explain some strange consequences of the formulas in the situation where the incident and/or ﬁnal (semi-inﬁnite) medium are absorptive, such as calculating T {\textgreater} 1 in the absence of gain. We also discuss some implementation details like complex-plane branch cuts. Finally, we derive modiﬁed formulas for including one or more “incoherent” layers, i.e. very thick layers in which interference can be neglected. This document was written in conjunction with the “tmm” Python software package, which implements these calculations.},

They fabricated superconducting nanowires that were 15 nm wide by pattern transfer into a 6-nm-thick layer of NbN using cured HSQ as the etch mask. HSQ was cured using a postdevelop electron-beam exposure step prior to RIE in CF4 chemistry. This curing step was shown not to impact the resolution of the HSQ structures while increasing their etch resistance. The results of the authors demonstrate that the etch resistance of HSQ can be tuned after development, which is a desirable resist property of HSQ in addition to its high resolution and low line-edge roughness. © 2006 American Vacuum Society.

A post exposure baking (PEB) process and hot development process with low concentration (3.5 wt\%) of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution were introduced to realize the grating pattern. To study the effects of post exposure baking on the HSQ resist, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out. From the FT-IR and XPS analyses, it was verified that a thin SiO2 with high cross-linked network structure was formed on the HSQ surface during the PEB step. This SiO2 layer prevents the formation of unwanted bonds on the HSQ surface, which results in clearly defined grating structures with a 60-nm-gap and 200-nm-wide-ridge on the 220-nm-thick HSQ resist. The nanometer-scale grating pattern was successfully transfered to the 280-nm-thick silicon layer of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate by using inductively-coupled-plasma-reactive-ion-etching (ICP-RIE).},

It is a kind of promising resist used in fabrication of nanostructures such as transmission grating (TG), dots array, and chiral structures. But the poor sensitivity limits the extensive application of HSQ. And the property of HSQ in electron beam lithography is also studied little before. In this paper, from the viewpoint of chemical structure the property of HSQ in electron beam lithography has been proposed and experiments have also been presented with the variety of the exposure dose and development conditions. It is proved by experiments not only the sensitivity and contrast of HSQ but also the influence of proximity effect can be modulated by changing the baking temperature and concentration of developer with the same exposure conditions. 100 nm lines at 200 nm pitch grating patterns with excellent vertical side-wall and line-edge roughness have been achieved in more than 450 nm thickness HSQ layer by increasing the concentration of developer and reducing the baking temperature in combination with optimization of exposure conditions.},

This model is used to describe coherence properties of the five meter undulator source at the synchrotron storage ring PETRA III. In the case of XFEL sources the decomposition of the statistical fields into a sum of independently propagating transverse modes is used for the analysis of the coherence properties of these new sources. A detailed calculation is performed for the parameters of the SASE1 undulator at the European XFEL.

A previous study considered averaging via the use of multiple Morse wavelets. Here we consider time-domain smoothing and use of a single Morlet wavelet. Since the Morlet wavelet is complex-valued, we derive analytic results for the case of wavelet coherence calculated from complex-valued, jointly stationary and Gaussian time series. The temporally smoothed wavelet coherence can be written in terms of Welch’s overlapping segment averaging (WOSA) spectrum estimators, and by using multitaper equivalent representations for the WOSA estimators we show that Goodman’s distribution is appropriate asymptotically, and readily derive the appropriate degrees of freedom. The theoretical results are veriﬁed via simulations and illustrated using solar physics data.},

	abstract = {We have previously described the usefulness of the magnitude-squared coherence function in analysis of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) (Ear Hear., 1989, 20: 2-13). For each frequency of interest, the coherence value can be compared to a 'critical value' to determine whether a response is present. Coherence functions must be smoothed across either multiple subaverages or adjacent frequencies (or both) to be reliable, but there are trade-offs: increasing the degree of smoothing increases computational time and (in the case of frequency smoothing) reduces spectral resolution. Using AEPs to clicks and amplitude-modulated tones we investigated the effects of variable degrees of smoothing on threshold estimates in 10 normal human subjects. Thresholds were found to be lower for coherence estimates than for visual detection and are also lower for longer data collection periods. However, there appears to be little if any advantage to segment smoothing beyond 8-16 subaverages. The optimal degree of frequency smoothing is more difficult to specify, depending on the spectrum of the AEP being analyzed (especially the rate of change of phase), and the spectral resolution of the analysis system.},

	abstract = {Optical proximity correction (OPC) and phase-shifting mask (PSM) are resolution enhancement techniques (RET) used extensively in the semiconductor industry to improve the resolution and pattern fidelity of optical lithography. Traditional RETs, however, fix the source thus limiting the degrees of freedom during the optimization of the mask patterns. To overcome this restriction, a set of simultaneous source and mask optimization (SMO) methods have been developed recently where the resulting source and mask patterns fall well outside the realm of known design forms. This paper focuses on developing computationally efficient, pixel-based, simultaneous source mask optimization methods for both OPC and PSM designs, where the synergy is exploited in the joint optimization of source and mask patterns. The Fourier series expansion model is applied to approximate the partially coherent system as a sum of coherent systems. Cost sensitivity is used to drive the output pattern error in the descent direction. In order to influence the solution patterns to have more desirable manufacturability properties, topological constraints are added to the optimization framework. Several illustrative simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

	abstract = {As optical metasurfaces become progressively ubiquitous, the expectations from them are becoming increasingly complex. The limited number of structural parameters in the conventional metasurface building blocks, and existing phase engineering rules do not completely support the growth rate of metasurface applications. In this paper, we present digitized-binary elements, as alternative high-dimensional building blocks, to accommodate the needs of complex-tailorable-multifunctional applications. To design these complicated platforms, we demonstrate adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA), as a powerful evolutionary optimizer, capable of handling such demanding design expectations. We solve four complex problems of high current interest to the optics community, namely, a binary-pattern plasmonic reflectarray with high tolerance to fabrication imperfections and high reflection efficiency for beam-steering purposes, a dual-beam aperiodic leaky-wave antenna, which diffracts TE and TM excitation waveguides modes to arbitrarily chosen directions, a compact birefringent all-dielectric metasurface with finer pixel resolution compared to canonical nano-antennas, and a visible-transparent infrared emitting/absorbing metasurface that shows high promise for solar-cell cooling applications, to showcase the advantages of the combination of binary-pattern metasurfaces and the AGA technique. Each of these novel applications encounters computational and fabrication challenges under conventional design methods, and is chosen carefully to highlight one of the unique advantages of the AGA technique. Finally, we show that large surplus datasets produced as by-products of the evolutionary optimizers can be employed as ingredients of the new-age computational algorithms, such as, machine learning and deep leaning. In doing so, we open a new gateway of predicting the solution to a problem in the fastest possible way based on statistical analysis of the datasets rather than researching the whole solution space.},

The authors performed lithographic exposures on high-numerical-aperture immersion and dry ArF systems as a function of source pulse duration and have quantified the speckle impacts on measured photoresist line-edge roughness (LER) and linewidth roughness (LWR) using immersion and dry lithography processes. Measurements were obtained for multiple feature sizes, pitches, and illumination modes using both static and scanning exposures. They have compared the measured LWR due to laser speckle to results of a line-roughness image model, which accounts for the LER, LWR, and critical dimension uniformity due to the effective dose variation from laser speckle. Finally, the authors present measurements that demonstrate the proportionality between laser speckle contrast and the inverse root of the TIS pulse duration and find that the lithographic LWR exhibits a similar relationship with pulse duration.},

	abstract = {Multibeam interference represents an approach for producing one-, two-, and three-dimensional periodic optical-intensity distributions with submicrometer features and periodicities. Accordingly, interference lithography (IL) has been used in a wide variety of applications, typically requiring additional lithographic steps to modify the periodic interference pattern and create integrated functional elements. In the present work, pattern-integrated interference lithography (PIIL) is introduced. PIIL is the integration of superposed pattern imaging with IL. Then a pattern-integrated interference exposure system (PIIES) is presented that implements PIIL by incorporating a projection imaging capability in a novel three-beam interference configuration. The purpose of this system is to fabricate, in a single-exposure step, a two-dimensional periodic photonic-crystal lattice with nonperiodic functional elements integrated into the periodic pattern. The design of the basic system is presented along with a model that simulates the resulting optical-intensity distribution at the system sample plane where the three beams simultaneously interfere and integrate a superposed image of the projected mask pattern. Appropriate performance metrics are defined in order to quantify the characteristics of the resulting photonic-crystal structure. These intensity and lattice-vector metrics differ markedly from the metrics used to evaluate traditional photolithographic imaging systems. Simulation and experimental results are presented that demonstrate the fabrication of example photonic-crystal structures in a single-exposure step. Example well-defined photonic-crystal structures exhibiting favorable intensity and lattice-vector metrics demonstrate the potential of PIIL for fabricating dense integrated optical circuits.},

The measurement of modulation transfer function of critical dimension (CD) is main performance parameter to evaluate the line width of semiconductor platform fabricating ability for the smallest line width of producing tiny integrated circuits. Although the modulation transfer function (MTF) has been popularly used to evaluation the optical system, but in lithography, the contrast of each line-pair is in one dimension or two dimensions, analytically, while the lens stand along in the test bench integrated with the light source coherent or near coherent for the small dimension near the optical diffraction limit, the MTF is not only contributed by the lens, also by illumination of platform. In the study, the partial coherence modulation transfer function (PCMTF) for testing a lithography lens is suggested by measuring MTF in the high spatial frequency of in situ lithography lens, blended with the illumination of partial and in coherent light source. PCMTF can be one of measurement to evaluate the imperfect lens of lithography lens for further improvement in lens performance.},

In this study, the main factors influencing OPC were investigated. These include asymmetric aberrations and optical proximity effects (OPE) in line patterns.

We then compare pattern fidelity in aerial images after DDM-OPC to aerial images using rigorous simulation of electric and magnetic field. Finally we quantify PPE in resist images with modeled 1D layouts after a perfect OPC. The perfect OPC corrects optical proximity effect, azimuthal angle through slit, and lens aberration. The forecasted PPE residual error after perfect OPC is 0.21 nm (x) and 0.76 nm (y) that can be attributed to uncorrectable components of wafer defocus and mask flatness.

In the basic design, the transformer primary circuit consists of two copper plates connected by a conductive tube at the center. The primary current flows radially in on one plate, axially through the central connection, and radially outward through the second plate. The induced secondary currents flow in a plasma through three electrically parallel paths that pierce the primary structure in three places (the plasma return holes), and then combine in the central bore. Figure 4.1 shows this geometry. Sandwiched between the plates are two magnetic cores. The inner core, closely surrounding the central bore, provides the magnetic flux linkage between the primary current path through the copper and the three parallel secondary currents flowing in the plasma, which combine in the bore to generate the magnetic Z-pinch. The second core is near the outer radius of the device and surrounds the three plasma return holes. This core functions as a magnetic switch with a specific volt-second capacity matched to the capacitance and charging system described below. Figure A4.2 shows a crosssection of the structure.},

With each new technology generation, the role of lithography has increased in importance not only because of the requirements for smaller feature sizes and tighter overlay, but also because of the increasing costs for lithography tools. Optical projection lithography and its extensions, e.g., water immersion, are expected to remain the lithographic technologies of choice until at least 2010. Extreme-ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) extends optical lithography to a higher resolution and provides a larger depth of focus because it utilizes a shorter imaging wavelength (13.5 nm versus 193–248 nm) and employs a smaller numerical aperture (NA) imaging system (0.25–0.45 NA versus 0.93–1.35 NA). This chapter recounts the early years of EUVL development, from the first imaging with normal-incidence multilayer (ML)-coated mirrors in 1981 to the beginning of EUVL commercialization efforts at the end of 1996.},

It is shown that the classical aperture-plane formulation degenerates when the wave front, as truncated at the aperture, has any degree of curvature to it, whereas the wave-front formulation produces accurate results from up to one aperture diameter behind the aperture plane. It is also shown that the Huygens-Fresnel-Kirchhoff incident-plane-wave-aperture-plane-integration and incident-spherical-wave-wave-front-integration formulations produce equally accurate results for apertures with exit f-numbers as small as 1.},

The package has been developed at European XFEL for users at the existing and emerging free-electron laser (FEL) facilities, as well as at the third-generation synchrotron sources and future diffraction-limited storage rings. The

The framework runs reliably under Linux, Microsoft Windows 7 and Apple Mac OS X and is distributed under an open-source license. The available tools allow for varying source parameters and optics layouts and visualizing the results interactively. The wavefront history structure can be used for tracking changes in every particular wavefront during propagation. The batch propagation mode enables processing of multiple wavefronts in workflow mode.

However, even in these new SR sources, the radiation produced by relativistic electrons (in undulators, wigglers and bending magnets) will remain only partially coherent in the X-ray spectral range. “Extraction” of “coherent portion” of the radiation flux and its transport to sample without loss of coherence must be performed by dedicated SR beamlines, optimized for particular types of experiments. Detailed quantitative prediction of partially coherent X-ray beam properties at propagation through optical elements, which is required for the optimization of such beamlines, can only be obtained from accurate and efficient physical-optics based numerical simulations. Examples of such simulations, made for NSLS-II beamlines, using “Synchrotron Radiation Workshop” (SRW) computer code, are presented. Special attention is paid to the numerical analysis of the basic properties of partially coherent undulator radiation beam and its distinctions from the Gaussian beam. Performance characteristics of importance for particular beamlines, such as radiation spot size and flux at sample vs size of secondary source aperture for high-resolution microscopy beamlines, are predicted by the simulations.},

Based on the commissioning results, a realistic simulation of the whole beamline, including source and optics, has been performed leveraging a ‘virtual beamline’ module of the ‘Synchrotron Radiation Workshop’ (SRW) code in a web browser based interface to the code named ‘Sirepo’. This virtual beamline capability is used here to simulate partially coherent small angle scattering patterns of samples relevant to the CHX science case, mimicking ‘detector images’ of real experiments. Such source-to-detector simulations of experiments allow for an accurate estimation of feasibility of a given experiment, for an optimization of the beamline setup and interpretation of experimental results.},

The method assumes that it is possible to freely and independently rotate the separate 2D transverse phase spaces in the horizontal and vertical directions. Using images of the beam that would be captured on a screen, we develop a mathematical procedure that will reconstruct the full 4D particle distribution. We simulate this procedure for a hypothetical distribution and show that the reconstruction agrees with the actual distribution. Finally, we demonstrate for the practical case of a two-quadrupole setup that it is indeed possible to adjust the quadrupole strengths so that the separate 2D transverse phase spaces can be rotated independently. However, in this setup, the rotation angles are restricted to smaller ranges. Even so, the reconstructed results reproduce the actual distribution clearly.},

	abstract = {In the absence of a lens to form an image, incoherent or partially coherent light scattering oﬀ an obstructive or reﬂective object forms a broad intensity distribution in the far ﬁeld with only feeble spatial features. We show here that measuring the complex spatial coherence function can help in the identiﬁcation of the size and location of a one-dimensional object placed in the path of a partially coherent light source. The complex coherence function is measured in the far ﬁeld through wavefront sampling, which is performed via dynamically reconﬁgurable slits implemented on a digital micromirror device (DMD). The impact of an object – parameterized by size and location – that either intercepts or reﬂects incoherent light is studied. The experimental results show that measuring the spatial coherence function as a function of the separation between two slits located symmetrically around the optical axis can identify the object transverse location and angle subtended from the detection plane (the ratio of the object width to the axial distance from the detector). The measurements are in good agreement with numerical simulations of a forward model based on Fresnel propagators. The rapid refresh rate of DMDs may enable real-time operation of such a lensless coherency imaging scheme.},

	abstract = {Freie Elektronen Laser (FELs) haben dank ihrer ultrakurzen, hochintensiven und koharenten Strahlung hervorragende Moglichkeiten im Bereich der Wissenschaft mit Rontgenstrahlung geschaffen. Zur Zeit basieren die meisten FELs auf dem Mechanismus der Selbstverstaerkung spontaner Emission (englische Abk. SASE), einem stochastischen Prozess, was sich in der Emission von Pulsen mit stark fluktuierenden Eigenschaften manifestiert. Eine Vielzahl neuartiger Experimente an FELs bedarf stark fokussierter Strahlung. Ins- besondere fur die Abbildung einzelner, nichtkristalliner, biologischer Teilchen, wird da- her eine genaue Charakterisierung spezifischer Eigenschaften des komplexen Wellenfeldes des FELs in Abhangigkeit der Maschinenparameter fu r jeden einzelnen Schuss benotigt. Ein deterministischer Zugang, der auf verschiedene FEL Strahlungsregime angewendet werden kann ist zur Untersuchung der Rontgenstrahleigenschaften wunschenswert. Eine statistische Auswertung der ermittelten Eigenschaften fur eine Anzahl verschiedener Pulsensembles fuhrt somit zu einem Verstandnis der Strahlungscharakteristiken und kann potenziel zur Optimierung dieser verwendet werden. Die systematische Veranderung der Strahlungsregime und quantitative Messung von Pulsen, die sich von Schuss zu Schuss innerhalb des Ensembles unterscheiden, erlaubt die Beobachtung der Variabilitat gemessener Parameter zwischen verschiedenen Ensemblen. 
 
In dieser Arbeit werden verschiedene Realisierungen und Methoden der Messung fokussierter Lichtfelder an der Beamline BL2 am Freie Elektronenlaser Hamburg (FLASH) in unterschiedlichen Strahlungsregimen untersucht. Fur hochgradig koharente Strahlung wird eine iterative Beugungsbildgebungstechnik weiterentwickelt, die Phasenrekonstruktion auf einzelne Fernfeld-Beugungsmuster von hochfokussierten Pulsen anwendet. Ein Vergleich mit dem klassischen Wellenfront-Messverfahren nach Hartmann schafft hierbei Vertrauen in die Gultigkeit der neuentwickelten iterativen Methode. 
 
Fur partiell koha rente Pulse konvergiert die iterative Methode jedoch nicht. Daher wird ein verallgemeinerter iterativer Algorithmus entwickelt und demonstriert, der Konzepte der optischen Theorie partiell koharenter Rontgenstrahlen, basierend auf dem Schellschen Theorem, benutzt. Dieser Algorithmus erlaubt sowohl die Rekonstruktion des komplexen Wellenfeldes als auch eine Abschatzung der raumlichen Koharenz einzel- ner Pulse. Der so ermittelte Koharenzgrad in verschiedenen Strahlungsregimen ist in guter Ubereinstimmung mit Simulationen der FEL Strahleigenschaften. Im Vergleich zu herkommlichen Methoden wird hierbei der Koharenzgrad und andere Parameter des Wellenfeldes mit der geringstmoglichen Menge an verfugbarer Information, der Messung eines einzelnen zweidimensionalen Beugungsmusters, gewonnen. Diese bildgebenden Verfahren sind uber einen sehr breiten Bereich von Photonenenergien anwendbar, da keine absorbierenden optischen Elemente zwischen der fokussierenden Optik und dem Detektor benotigt sind. 
 
Als zusatzliche Information kann ferner die longitudinale Quellposition im aktiven Undulatorsegment aus beiden Algorithmen genau ermittelt werden. Dies liefert weiteren Aufschluss daruber wie die Maschinenparameter des FELs die optischen Eigenschaften des Rontgenstrahls beeinflussen. 
 
 
Free-Electron-Lasers (FELs) have enabled tremendous possibilities in x-ray science due to their ultrashort, highly intense and coherent radiation. At present, FELs rely pri- marily on the Self Amplified Spontaneous Emission process, which is of a stochastic nature, and emit pulses which may fluctuate drastically from shot to shot. Since many of the novel experiments at FELs require a high degree of beam focusing, in particular for imaging single non-crystalline biological particles, it is imperative to characterize the specific properties of single-shot focused complex wave fields versus different states of the FEL machine. Therefore, a deterministic approach applicable to various FEL operation regimes is desirable to enable the investigation of photon beam properties. The statis- tical evaluation of the determined properties over different ensembles of pulses leads to an understanding of and potentially optimization of the radiation to be delivered. 
 
In this thesis, I have studied different realizations and methods of focused wave field determination at beamline BL2 at the Free electron Laser At Hamburg (FLASH) for various radiation regimes. An iterative diffraction imaging technique has been developed to study highly coherent pulses. The method comprises of a phase retrieval algorithm applied to single far-field diffraction patterns of highly focused pulses. Also, the Hart- mann Wavefront Sensing method, as a classical approach, has been applied to measure photon beam properties in the same machine state. The comparison of results has built confidence in the validity of the imaging method. 
 
A transition to partially coherent radiation caused the algorithmic convergence of the iterative technique to fail. Therefore, a general iterative algorithm has been demon- strated based on Schell’s theorem to reconstruct single-shot complex wave fields, as well as estimating the spatial degree of coherence. The properties of measured pulses have been determined with the lowest level of available information compared to the conventional methods, as a single-shot 2D diffraction pattern measured in the far-field. These imaging methods are applicable across a very broad photon energy range since no absorptive optics are needed between the focusing optics and the detector. 
 
Additionally, the variation in longitudinal source position within the operating undula- tor segments has been determined precisely as feedback from both algorithms, providing further insight into how FEL machine parameters influence the optical properties of the photon beam.},

As a typical application we report on online measurements of photon beam parameters during mirror alignment. A compact Hartmann sensor, operating in the wavelength range from 4 - 38 nm, was used to determine the wave front quality as well as aberrations of individual free-electron laser (FEL) pulses during the alignment procedure. Beam characterization and alignment of the focusing optics of FLASH beamline BL3 were performed with λ13.5nm/116 accuracy for wave front rms (wrms) repeatability, resulting in a reduction of wrms by 33 \% during alignment.},

In addition, a comparison with the imprint technique conﬁrms the validity of the results, which showed that wavefront-based alignment resulted in negligible astigmatism.

So far, the probes were assumed to be completely known (amplitude, wavefront, state of polarization), which is rarely the case in practice. Here we address the issue of the joint estimating of the set of polarized illumination probes together with the Jones matrix of an anisotropic object in vectorial ptychography. We propose an algorithm based on a conjugate gradient strategy. Experimental results are reported, showing an improvement on the object estimate, in addition to a precise reconstruction of the probes.},

The radiation field is substituted for an equivalent Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) and its coherent mode decomposition (CMD). Both the two methods can effectively described the beam properties at any position in free space. But they all have merits and limitations. The simulation of GSM exactly describes the beam for all modes are included, but the amount of calculation of GSM is very great. While CMD is an easy to comprehend and more convenient approach but the simulated beam should be highly coherent for modes number can not be large. In previous simulation, modes with a contribution of less than 0.01 were neglected, but our simulation results demonstrate that the ratio 0.01 should goes down to 0.001, then CMD can exactly simulates the beam properties.},

	abstract = {The Fokker--Planck Equation can be used in a partially-coherent imaging context to model the evolution of the intensity of a paraxial x-ray wave field with propagation. This forms a natural generalisation of the transport-of-intensity equation. The x-ray Fokker--Planck equation can simultaneously account for both propagation-based phase contrast, and the diffusive effects of sample-induced small-angle x-ray scattering, when forming an x-ray image of a thin sample. Two derivations are given for the Fokker--Planck equation associated with x-ray imaging, together with a Kramers--Moyal generalisation thereof. Both equations are underpinned by the concept of unresolved speckle due to unresolved sample micro-structure. These equations may be applied to the forward problem of modelling image formation in the presence of both coherent and diffusive energy transport. They may also be used to formulate associated inverse problems of retrieving the phase shifts due to a sample placed in an x-ray beam, together with the diffusive properties of the sample. The domain of applicability for the Fokker--Planck and Kramers--Moyal equations for paraxial imaging is at least as broad as that of the transport-of-intensity equation which they generalise, hence the technique is also expected to be useful for paraxial imaging using visible light, electrons and neutrons.},

We show that the Shannon sampling of diffraction intensities needed in CDI requires a coherence width about twice the lateral dimensions of the object, and that the linear number of detector pixels fixes the energy spread needed in the beam. The Shannon sampling, defined by the transform of the periodically repeated autocorrelation of the object, is related to Bragg scattering from an equivalent crystal, and shown to be consistent with the sampling of Young's fringes established by scattering from extreme points in the object. The results are relevant to the design of diffraction cameras for CDI and plans for femotosecond X-ray diffraction from individual proteins.},

Experimental database of beyond extreme ultraviolet (BEUV) radiation was obtained by using spherically symmetrical high-Z plasmas generated with spherically allocated laser beams. Absolute energy and spectra of BEUV light emitted from Tb, Gd, and Mo plasmas were measured with a absolutely calibrated BEUV calorimeter and a transmission grating spectrometer. 1.0 × 1012 W/cm2 is the optimal laser intensity to produced efficient BEUV light source plasmas with Tb and Gd targets. Maximum CE is achieved at 0.8\% that is two times higher than the published CEs obtained with planar targets.},

              Well-defined model systems are needed for better understanding of the relationship between optical, electronic, magnetic, and catalytic properties of nanoparticles and their structure. Chemical synthesis of metal nanoparticles results in large size and shape dispersion and lack of lateral order. In contrast, conventional top-down lithography techniques provide control over the lateral order and dimensions. However, they are either limited in resolution or have low throughput and therefore do not enable the large patterning area needed to obtain good signal-to-noise ratio in common analytical and characterization techniques. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has the throughput and simplicity advantages of photolithography as well as high resolution due to its wavelength. Using EUV achromatic Talbot lithography, we have obtained 15 nm particle arrays with a periodicity of about 100 nm over an area of several square centimeters with high-throughput enabling the use of nanotechnology for fabrication of model systems to study large ensembles of well-defined identical nanoparticles with a density of 10

	abstract = {An experimental procedure for transmission X-ray ghost imaging using synchrotron light is presented. Hard X-rays from an undulator were divided by a beamsplitter to produce two copies of a speckled incident beam. Both beams were simultaneously measured on an indirect pixellated detector and the intensity correlation between the two copies was used to retrieve the ghost image of samples placed in one of the two beams, without measuring the samples directly. Aiming at future practical uses of X-ray ghost imaging, the authors discuss details regarding data acquisition, image reconstruction strategies and measure the point-spread function of the ghost-imaging system. This approach may become relevant for applications of ghost imaging with X-ray sources such as undulators in storage rings, free-electron lasers and lower-coherence laboratory facilities.},

The goal of inverse problems is to ﬁnd the best mask, imaging system, or process to print the given wafer features. In this study, we proposed the strict formalization and fast solution methods of inverse mask problems. We stated inverse mask problems ͑or “layout inversion” problems͒ as nonlinear, constrained minimization problems over a domain of mask pixels. We considered linear, quadratic, and nonlinear formulations of the objective function. The linear problem is solved by an enhanced version of the Nashold projections. The quadratic problem is addressed by eigenvalue decompositions and quadratic programming methods. The general nonlinear formulation is solved by the local variations and gradient descent methods. We showed that the gradient of the objective function can be calculated analytically through convolutions. This is an important practical result because it enables layout inversion on a large scale in order of M log M operations for M pixels.},

Applying similarity techniques to the results of numerical simulations allowed us to ﬁnd universal scaling relations for the main characteristics of an XFEL operating in the saturation regime: efﬁciency, coherence time and degree of transverse coherence. We ﬁnd that with an appropriate normalization of these quantities, they are functions of only the ratio of the geometrical emittance of the electron beam to the radiation wavelength.

	abstract = {The feasibility of using thin films of organic material as a protective cover for x-ray lithography masks has been demonstrated. A pellicle structure that fits unobtrusively inside the mask-wafer gap and on the x-ray lithography NIST standard ring was developed. The pellicle solves several problems: 1) protects the mask absorber from direct contact to external sources of possible damage without itself contacting the absorber, 2) allows effective cleaning of the x-ray mask by preventing dust or debris particles from getting imbedded in the absorber pattern, 3) reduces contamination of the stepper and wafers by absorber metal debris in the event of catastrophic breakage of the mask membrane, 4) reduces contamination of the absorber pattern by debris generated by the resist or the stepper environment during x-ray exposure, and 5) reduces photoelectrons generated by the absorber during x-ray exposure from reaching the resist. Furthermore, pellicles may offer inspection advantages by providing a flat surface without absorber topography. Several approaches for the fabrication of suitable pellicles using organic and inorganic films will be presented in this paper. Pellicles have been successfully tested in the SVGL and SUSS steppers in the IBM Advanced Lithography Facility in the East Fishkill, NY. Results on pellicle's performance together with radiation damage measurements to estimate a pellicle's lifetime are presented in this paper.},

	abstract = {Thick SU-8 photoresist has been a popular photoresist material to fabricate various mechanical, biological, and chemical devices for many years. The accuracy and precision of the ultraviolet (UV) lithography process of thick SU-8 depend on key parameters in the set-up, the material properties of the SU-8 resist, and the thickness of the resist structure. As feature sizes get smaller and pattern complexity increases, accurate control and efficient optimization of the lithography process are significantly expected. Numerical simulations can be employed to improve understanding and process design of the SU-8 lithography, thereby allowing rapid related product and process development. A typical comprehensive lithography of UV lithography of thick SU-8 includes aerial image simulation, exposure simulation, post-exposure bake (PEB) simulation, and development simulation, and this article presents an overview of the essential aspects in the comprehensive simulation. At ﬁrst, models for the lithography process of the SU-8 are discussed. Then, main algorithms for etching surface evolvement, including the string, ray tracing, cellular automaton, and fast marching algorithms, are introduced and compared with each other in terms of performance. After that, some simulation results of the UV lithography process of the SU-8 are presented, demonstrating the promising potential and efficiency of the simulation technology. Finally, a prospect is discussed for some open questions in three-dimensional (3D) comprehensive simulation of the UV lithography of the SU-8.},

	abstract = {Imaging is an important means by which information is gathered regarding the physical world. Spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio are underpinning concepts. There is a paucity of rigorous definitions for these quantities, which are general enough to be useful in a broad range of imaging problems, while being also sufficiently specific to enable precise quantitative evaluation of the relevant properties of imaging systems. This is particularly true for many modern forms of imaging that include digital processing of the acquired imaging data as an integral step leading to final images presented to an end-user. Here, both the well-known historical definitions of spatial resolution and some more recent approaches suitable for many forms of modern computational imaging are discussed. An intrinsic duality of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise exists in almost all types of imaging, with the related uncertainty relationship determining a trade-off between the two quantities. Examples are presented with applications to super-resolution imaging, inline holography and ghost imaging.},

We also discuss recent developments in relativistic electron beam physics that give us the possibility of designing a new generation of X-ray free-electron lasers that: a. are more compact; b. reduce the radiation pulse duration to one femtosecond or below; c. extend the photon energy to the 50 keV region. These results are obtained by reducing the electron bunch charge while at same time maximizing the beam brightness and reducing the bunch length to a value near or smaller than the free-electron laser cooperation length. In the last case the radiation pulse is fully coherent in the longitudinal and transverse space. The increase in beam brightness can also be used to reduce the beam energy needed for a given radiation wavelength, when, at the same time, the undulator period is reduced. The simultaneous decrease in beam energy and undulator period leads to a more compact free-electron laser, while the high beam brightness reduces the gain length and increases the coherent radiation intensity.},

Currently EUV resist development is primarily focused on large-scale screening efforts in an attempt to identify platforms showing promise in a variety of areas with resolution arguably being the parameter of highest importance at this time. The characterization of the intrinsic resolution limit of resists, however, is not a trivial issue due to practical complications such as pattern collapse and top-loss. Note that the intrinsic resist resolution limit has been claimed to be determined by the resist diffusion length and various metrics have been proposed to characterize this diffusion length as well as resist resolution. Here we investigate a variety of resolution and diffusion length metrics and study the correlation between these metrics and observed resist performance when applied to a variety of leading EUV resists. The metrics we study include iso-focal bias, line-edge-roughness correlation length, resist modulation transfer function, and corner rounding.},

	title = {Propagation of partially coherent light in optical systems},
	abstract = {There are in general three approaches to propagate partially coherent light. They include solving the Helmholtz equations for the correlation function, employing the Wigner function to propagate light in phase space, or using modal expansion. In this work, we investigate the interaction of partially spatially coherent light with optical systems. Our modeling methods are based on the Wigner function and modal expansion. First, we utilize the thin element approximation in the Wigner function to propagate partially coherent light through discontinuous surfaces. Our examples include the phase step, grating, kinoform lens, axicon and lens array. Phase space provides a vivid picture for understanding the diffraction effects, e.g. the diffracted orders formed by a grating, the multiple foci of a kinoform lens, and the beam homogenizing effect of a lens array, etc. This approach facilitates the design of diffractive elements and the interpretation of optical effects. Second, we improve the propagation algorithms for the Wigner function. These implementations include removing a parabolic wavefront of a beam, and an efficient propagator based on rotating the phase space. Both algorithms increase the computational speed without losing any physical accuracy. To overcome certain limitations of our phase space propagators, we investigate the modal expansion method. We use Schell beams as examples, to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of eigenmode and shifted-elementary mode expansions. Afterward, we develop an expansion tool to efficiently propagate partially coherent light inside waveguides. This tool allows quick access to the light fields at any distance inside the waveguide. We thus obtain an accurate modeling of the diffraction effects produced by the waveguide structure. Our modeling methods pave the path to the experimental measurement of coherence. We discuss two schemes to retrieve the spatial coherence of a beam under test. The first scheme is to solve an inverse problem of the modal expansion. It requires iterative phase retrieval algorithms to recover the complex fields of individual modes. We extend this method to a beam with an arbitrary wavefront and discuss the potential and limits of this technique. The second scheme for coherence retrieval is to solve the inverse problem of the Wigner function, also known as the phase space tomography. To reconstruct a Wigner function requires an inverse Radon transform in a four-dimensional space. We present an overview of the two relevant algorithms, i.e. the filtered back projection and the ambiguity function reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose an improved algorithm for the filtered back projection.},

For instance, the molecular structure of certain proteins and viruses has become accessible by coherent imaging techniques and already today, lithographic processes for the microchip production are being adapted to that wavelength range. For both examples, a comprehensive beam characterization is an essential condition for an ideal use of the available photons. Following that goal, this work addresses the pathway of extreme UV and soft x-ray radiation from its generation, through the beam transport by the beamline to the probe position. Experimentally, those aspects are optimized at a laser-produced plasma source and at an arrangement for the generation of high-harmonics. Additionally, the coherence of laser beams is analyzed by measurements of the Wigner distribution function. This method is applied to the photon beam of the free-electron laser FLASH, resulting in the entire characterization of its propagation properties},

The immense potential of the photon beam from SPEAR became obvious as soon as experiments using the beam started to run in May, 1974. The rapid growth of interest in using the beam since that time and the growth of other facilities using high-energy storage rings (see Chapters 1 and 3) demonstrates how the users of this source of radiation are finding applications in an increasingly wide variety of fields of science and technology. In assembling the list of authors for this book, we have tried to cover as many of the applications of synchrotron radiation, both realized already or in the process of realization, as we can. Inevitably, there are omissions both through lack of space and because many projects are at an early stage. We thank the authors for their efforts and cooperation in producing what we believe is the most comprehensive treatment of synchrotron radiation research to date.},

Naulleau, 1 Dimitra Niakoula, 1 and Guojing Zhang 2 Center for X-Ray Optics, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720 Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA 95052 Abstract As critical dimensions shrink, line edge and width roughness (LER and LWR) become of increasing concern. Traditionally LER is viewed as a resist-limited effect; however, as critical dimensions shrink and LER requirements become proportionally more stringent, system-level effects begin to play an important role. Recent advanced EUV resist testing results have demonstrated lower bounds on achievable LER at the level of approximately 2 to 3 nm. Here we use modeling to demonstrate that a significant portion of this low bound may in fact be do to system-level effects and in particular the mask. Of concern are both LER on the mask as well as roughness of the multilayer reflector. Modeling also shows roughness (flare) in the projection optics not to be of concern.

Modeling results have recently been used to determine the requirements for future production worthy masks yielding the extremely stringent specification of 50 pm rms roughness. Owing to the scale of the problem in terms of memory requirements, past modeling results have been based on the thin mask approximation in this application. EUV masks, however, are inherently three-dimensional (3D) in nature and thus the question arises as to the validity of the thin mask approximation. Here, we directly compare the image plane speckle calculation results using the fast two-dimensional thin mask model to rigorous finite-difference time-domain results and find the two methods to agree to within 10\% in the computation of the speckle magnitude and 20\% in the computation of the line-edge roughness limited depth of focus. For both types of computation, the two-dimensional method provides a conservative estimate. The 3D modeling is also used to show that layer-to-layer correlated roughness is indeed the roughness metric of most concern.},

Among others EUV lithography requires a brilliant radiation source with output power between 50 W and 120 W collected in an intermediate focus at the entrance of the exposure tool. The development of these powerful EUV sources will have spin-off products for applications related to inspection and quality control in lithography related industry. We also expect numerous applications in micro- and nano-machiningand –processingas well as microscopy at shortest wavelengths. In the present paper experimental results of both laser produced plasma and gas discharge produced plasma EUV source development at XTREME technologies – the EUV joint venture of Lambda Physik AG, Goettingen, and Jenoptik LOS GmbH, Jena, Germany – are presented. Source characterization has been performed with calibrated metrology tools for measurement of energy, power, size, spectra and stability of the EUV emission. The laser plasma investigations are performed with a 1st experimental facility comprising a commercial 40 W Nd:YAG laser coupled to a liquid xenon-jet target system, which was developed by XTREME technologies. The EUV in-band power emitted from the 0.25 mm diameter plasma into 2π solid angle is 0.2 W, the conversion efficiency amounts 0.5\%. Estimated EUV emission parameters usinga 500 W laser for plasma generation are discussed. The gas discharge EUV sources described here are based on efficient Xenon Z-pinches. In the},

In Berlin, this research programme started together with the user operation of the electron storage ring BESSY I in the early 1980s. At the beginning, the work was focused on fundamental radiometry, i.e. using the storage ring as a primary radiation source standard and operating beamlines for source and detector calibration in the vacuum ultraviolet spectral range. Meanwhile, at the electron storage rings BESSY II and Metrology Light Source in Berlin-Adlershof, the activities have been extended to a broad range of fundamental and applied photon metrology in the range from the far infrared to hard X-rays, including methods like cryogenic radiometry, reflectometry and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. In the present review, we give a short historical introduction to this work, describe our laboratories and the basic radiometric principles, and present examples of recent applications, largely performed within the framework of scientific cooperations with external partners from industry and research.

Starting from the statistical optics and using mutual coherence function of the radiation ﬁeld, we deﬁne the transverse and temporal coherence and modes. Spectral brightness can be represented in radiation phase-space via the Wigner function which is the Fourier transformation of the transverse correlation function. The brightness convolution theorem can be employed to calculate the total source brightness and the degree of transverse coherence of the radiation emitted by an electron beam. Undulator radiation possesses partial transverse coherence until the beam emittances can be reduced below the diffraction limit. For x-ray FELs the radiation has excellent transverse coherence and at least 9 orders of magnitude enhancement in peak brightness. Seeding can further improve temporal coherence of FELs. Future development includes diffraction limited light sources, higher peak and average power x-ray FELs and compact coherent radiation sources based on laser and plasma accelerators.},

The availability of defect-free masks is the most critical technol-ogy gap hindering the commercialization of extreme-UV (EUV) lithography. 1–3 Multilayer defects are generated during the man-ufacture of EUV mask blanks, the basis for the photomasks used to pattern computer chips. The insufficient rate of progress toward reducing the defects in mask blanks 4 across the EUV community over the past two years has prompted us at the SEMATECH (Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology) con-sortium to establish a Mask Blank Defect Reduction Program to provide immediate and long-term solutions to the industry. This Program has been tasked with identifying the source of defects within the multilayer deposition process, implementing mitiga-tion techniques, and demonstrating an improved process that yields a low density of defects. SEMATECH's Mask Blank Defect Reduction Program is sup-ported by the Mask Blank Development Center, a facility for developing defect-free EUV blanks built at the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany (see Figure 1). Two Nexus low-defect-density tools by Veeco Instruments are being used for process development of the deposition of molybdenum/silicon with an integrated ruthenium capping layer, as well as targeted experiments to minimize specific defect types. 5 The low-defect-density tools each consist of two loadlocks to hold the sub-strate in place, a standard mechanical interface (SMIF) unit, an aligner, a transfer module, and the deposition chamber. Each of the deposition tools (see Figure 2) can accommo-date 6-inch-square mask substrates. The substrates are loaded from the SMIF pod into the loadlock with the SMIF indexer. The loadlock is exposed to low-and high-speed pumping Figure 1. An overview of SEMATECH's Mask Blank Development Center in Albany, NY. Figure 2.

If the industry succeeds in reducing mask blank defects at the required rate of 10X every year for the next 2–3 years to meet high volume manufacturing defect requirements, new inspection and review tool capabilities will soon be needed to support this goal. This paper outlines the defect inspection and review tool technical requirements and suggests development plans to achieve pilot line readiness in 2011/12 and high volume manufacturing readiness in 2013. The technical specifications, tooling scenarios, and development plans were produced by a SEMATECH-led technical working group with broad industry participation from material suppliers, tool suppliers, mask houses, integrated device manufacturers, and consortia. The paper summarizes this technical working group’s assessment of existing blank and mask inspection/review infrastructure capabilities to support pilot line introduction and outlines infrastructure development requirements and tooling strategies to support high volume manufacturing.},

In this paper, two EUV mask blanks with known native buried phase defects were characterized with a Lasertec M7360 (266 nm wavelength), atomic force microscope (AFM), and SEMATECH’s actinic inspection tool (AIT), which is an EUV-wavelength microscope. The results show that there are various kinds of native defects on the mask blank. Not surprisingly, the surface height and measured EUV intensity profile of real blank defects can differ significantly from Gaussian-shaped defects. All defects found by the M7360 were observable in the AIT, yet many do not perturb the intensity enough to be printable in isolation. This paper shows that defects come in various sizes and types and clarifies what must be done to learn more about real defect printability to achieve defect-free mask blanks.},

These defects are an EUV-specific type of mask defects. Whereas the only true solution is to totally avoid the presence of such ML-defects during blank manufacturing, some level of capability of printability mitigation has been demonstrated, both by absorber compensation repair and by pattern shift. In both cases, it is essential that one can build on a full-proof blank inspection capability, that detects all printable blank defects, at a very low false detection rate, such as by using actinic blank inspection. This capability, together with providing accurate defect location information, establishes an essential prerequisite for their mitigation or avoidance. On the latter, the proposal is made to extend pattern shift to intentional pattern deformation.},

	abstract = {Stochastic effects in lithography are usually quantified through local CD variability metrics, such as line-width roughness or local CD uniformity (LCDU), and these quantities have been measured and studied intensively, both in EUV and optical lithography. Next to the CD-variability, stochastic effects can also give rise to local, random printing failures, such as missing contacts or microbridges in spaces. When these occur, there often is no (reliable) CD to be measured locally, and then such failures cannot be quantified with the usual CD-measuring techniques. We have developed algorithms to detect such stochastic printing failures in regular line/space (L/S) or contact- or dot-arrays from SEM images, leading to a stochastic failure metric that we call NOK (not OK), which we consider a complementary metric to the CD-variability metrics. This paper will show how both types of metrics can be used to experimentally quantify dependencies of stochastic effects to, e.g., CD, pitch, resist, exposure dose, etc. As it is also important to be able to predict upfront (in the OPC verification stage of a production-mask tape-out) whether certain structures in the layout are likely to have a high sensitivity to stochastic effects, we look into the feasibility of constructing simple predictors, for both stochastic CD-variability and printing failure, that can be calibrated for the process and exposure conditions used and integrated into the standard OPC verification flow. Finally, we briefly discuss the options to reduce stochastic variability and failure, considering the entire patterning ecosystem.},

Despite significant advances in our ability to clean substrates, the incoming substrate contributes more defects than the multilayer to the total number of defects on our lowest defect density mask blanks. This is because cleaning processes are ineffective against substrate pits, which dominate the substrate defect distribution. Fortunately, defect mitigation methods have been developed that use a coat-and-etch process to smooth substrate pit and particle defects. We have designed and installed a process module specifically for smoothing substrate pits and particles. This process module has several new features, such as the ability to isolate the etch source during the deposition steps, and should enable cleaner planarizations than those done before.},

Small particle contaminants on the substrate that can nucleate printable Mo/Si phase defects are a serious concern. We develop an ion-beam thin ﬁlm planarization process for mitigating the effect of small substrate contaminants that relies on enhancing the smoothing capability of Mo/Si multilayer ﬁlms; we observe that etching of the Si layers in between deposition steps can yield a signiﬁcant improvement in smoothing. Using this process substrate particles as large as 50 nm in diameter are smoothed to ϳ1 nm in height, rendering them harmless.

	abstract = {EUV mask defectivity is one of the challenges of realizing EUV lithography. EUV mask defects are a combination of substrate, multilayer blank, and absorber patterning defects. Each defect on the substrate or blank may be able to print depending on different factors. Therefore, at every stage of EUV mask manufacturing, care must be taken to control defectivity. This paper reviews EUV mask defectivity during manufacturing and use. Principles involved in EUV defect detection and sizing are discussed. With EUV, examining defects in a two dimensional (2D) space where defect detection can be correlated with defect printability predictions is most useful. To determine the critical defect size on a multilayer, existing printability prediction modeling can be used. However to calculate defect size on a substrate, detailed information about the multilayer deposition process is needed. Defects {\textless} 2 nm deep with a full width half maximum (FWHM) {\textless} 20 nm on the substrate will be completely smoothed by the current multilayer deposition processes in use at SEMATECH. Defects {\textgreater} 2 nm deep with a FWHM {\textless} 20 nm after multilayer deposition become wider but their depth remains constant (0.6 nm) regardless of their width on the substrate. Cleaning-induced pits will contribute to both low thermal expansion material (LTEM) and Ru-capped multilayer blank defectivity. Particles added by the cleaning tool and processes are another key contributor to EUV mask, blank and substrate defectivity. Changes in EUV reflectivity due to multiple cleanings are likewise critical. Cleaning chemistries will also etch the absorber lines and antireflecting coatings (ARCs), which in turn will alter the mask critical dimensions (CDs). Finally, cleaning the mask may increase its surface roughness, which may change the line edge roughness (LER).},

The short wavelength of the incident illumination allows for a considerable decrease in printed feature size, but also creates a range of technological challenges not present for traditional optical lithography. Contamination and oxidation form on multilayer reﬂecting optics surfaces that not only reduce system throughput because of the associated reduction in EUV reﬂectivity, but also introduce wavefront aberrations that compromise the ability to print uniform features. Capping layers of ruthenium, ﬁlms \$2 nm thick, are found to extend the lifetime of Mo/Si multilayer mirrors used in EUV lithography applications. However, reﬂectivities of even the Ru-coated mirrors degrade in time during exposure to EUV radiation. Ruthenium surfaces are chemically reactive and are very effective as heterogeneous catalysts. In the present paper we summarize the thermal and radiation-induced surface chemistry of bare Ru exposed to gases; the emphasis is on H2O vapor, a dominant background gas in vacuum processing chambers. Our goal is to provide insights into the fundamental physical processes that affect the reﬂectivity of Ru-coated Mo/Si multilayer mirrors exposed to EUV radiation.

	abstract = {A UV-sensitive, image-mapped detector utilizing state-of-the-art charge-coupled device technology was designed for use with an echelle spectrometer for a simultaneous inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer system. The image-mapped detector consists of 70 diagonalized linear arrays (DLA) of photoactive picture elements (pixels) arranged to match exactly the angle and the curvature of each individual diffraction order in the image focal plane of the spectrometer. Each DLA is designed to have a length that matches the length of the free spectral range of the order that it tracks, resulting in exceptionally broad wavelength coverage of the spectrum of interest using more than 70 000 pixels. Each of the DLA transfer registers is further divided into two half-registers with separate read electronics to double the readout speed of the device. The readout and related charge-transfer circuitry is positioned between the arrays of photosensitive pixels, in the area where no spectral information will exist. Each of the 140 DLA transfer half-registers has its own dedicated amplification and final readout circuits at the end of each half-register. This arrangement allows for independent control of integration time within each DLA and greatly enhances its linear dynamic range as a simultaneous detection system. The extensive wavelength coverage and large dynamic range, coupled with superior deep ultraviolet sensitivity and extremely fast readout, make this image-mapped device an ideal detector for emission spectroscopy.},

Laser illumination is delivered to the object by means of an infinity corrected microscope objective, either by a galvanometer scanning system or a widefield fibre optic. Wavelength selection of Raman scattered emission is achieved by an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF), which maintains image fidelity and provides either continuous or random wavelength selection. The collimated AOTF output is imaged first by a tube lens and then by a projection lens onto a cooled silicon CCD array. Instrument features, including factors that determine the system’s spatial and spectral resolution, and design considerations are discussed in detail. Images and spectra of test objects and samples that demonstrate the capability of this imaging spectrometer are presented. The potential of intrinsic chemical imaging is discussed in terms of its use in the analyses of a variety of chemical and biological samples.},

	title = {Optical {Proximity} {Correction} with {Principal} {Component} {Regression}},
	abstract = {An important step in today’s Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing is optical proximity correction (OPC). In model based OPC, masks are systematically modiﬁed to compensate for the non-ideal optical and process effects of optical lithography system. The polygons in the layout are fragmented, and simulations are performed to determine the image intensity pattern on the wafer. Then the mask is perturbed by moving the fragments to match the desired wafer pattern. This iterative process continues until the pattern on the wafer matches the desired one. Although OPC increases the ﬁdelity of pattern transfer to the wafer, it is quite CPU intensive; OPC for modern IC designs can take days to complete on computer clusters with thousands of CPU. In this paper, techniques from statistical machine learning are used to predict the fragment movements. The goal is to reduce the number of iterations required in model based OPC by using a fast and efﬁcient solution as the initial guess to model based OPC. To determine the best model, we train and evaluate several principal component regression models based on prediction error. Experimental results show that fragment movement predictions via regression model signiﬁcantly decrease the number of iterations required in model based OPC.},

It presents the basic ideas that govern the system approach for describing and analyzing quantitative imaging systems for fluorescence microscopy. Use of the linear, shift-invariant (LSI) model for describing the complete system has given an elegant tool, the optical transfer function (OW), to describe the imaging system's resolution capabilities. It has also enabled to understand how an object much smaller than a wavelength of light can be visualized. Using simple test patterns it is seen how it is possible to measure the contrast modulation transfer function (CMTF). The chapter describes how every acquired fluorescence image is a compromise between the actual distribution of light and the constraints of physics and engineering that prevent us from observing it. This distortion is inherent in the observation process. At the very best, the data is obtained through quantitative fluorescence microscopy that will be a distortion of reality. The chapter also discusses the tools for understanding that distortion.},

Using the self-consistency of the recovered object, aberrations, and measured images as a metric, we optimize over the space of aberrations to estimate aberrations. Partially coherent illumination is needed to allow the eﬀects of the object ﬁeld and aberrations to be separated.

The issue of EUV phase roughness that can arise from either multilayer or capping layer roughness has recently garnered increasing concern. The problem with mask phase roughness is that it couples line-edge roughness (LER) through the formation of image plane speckle. The coupling from phase roughness to LER depends on many factors including roughness magnitude, roughness correlation length, illumination partial coherence, aberrations, defocus, and numerical aperture. Analysis shows that only on the order of 50 pm multilayer roughness may be tolerable at the 22-nm half-pitch node. Results also show that Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) may not be a suitable method for measuring mask phase roughness due to its sensitivity to the surface only. Capping layer roughness is another significant concern especially given that it has been shown to increase with cleaning cycles. In this case, however, AFM does provide a reasonable metric.},

We also describe the possibility to increase target defect SNR on target defect sizes at the price of losing the sensitivity on smaller (noncritical) defects. Moreover, we show the advantage of the optimized phase contrast (OZPC) method over BF EUV actinic blank inspection. A single focus scan from OZPC has better inspection efficiency over BF. Second, we make a detailed comparison between the phase contrast with apodization (AZPC) method and dark field (DF) method based on defect sensitivity in the presence of both photon shot noise and camera noise.

This approach produces results indistinguishable from methods such as coupled wave theory, and it allows one to reproduce other X-ray optical phenomena such as grazing incidence reﬂectivity where the direction of energy ﬂow is changed signiﬁcantly. Just as ﬁnite element analysis methods allow engineers to compute the thermal and mechanical responses of arbitrary structures too complex to model by analytical approaches, multislice propagation can be used to understand the properties of the real-world optics of ﬁnite extent and with local imperfections, allowing one to better understand the limits to nanoscale X-ray imaging.},

We report the dynamic creation of a transversely rotated HG mode along its propagating axis with the help of a fast amplitude digital micromirror device (DMD) and a binary encoding technique. Furthermore, this mechanism can also realize the dynamic deformation from a traditional HG beam to a vortex HG beam, which provides a deep insight into the detailed formation of optical vortex singularity in a light beam and would beneﬁt across singular optics and optical manipulation.},

	abstract = {Arbitrary intensity distributions may be written by transversely scanning a single spatially-random screen that is normally illuminated by spatially but not necessarily temporally uniform radiation or matter wave fields. The arbitrariness, of the written pattern, holds up to both (i) a spatial resolution that is dictated by the characteristic transverse length scale of the illuminated spatially random screen, and (ii) an additive constant. Two forms of the method are developed. The former assumes the distance between the illuminated random mask and the target plane to be sufficiently small that the effects of diffraction may be neglected. The latter accounts for the effects of Fresnel diffraction in the regime of large Fresnel number. Numerical simulations are provided for both variants of the method. The method may be parallelized, and is also suited to both magnifying and de-magnifying geometries. Possible applications include spatial light modulators and intensity projectors for those matter and radiation fields for which such devices do not exist, printing/micro-fabrication in both two and three spatial dimensions, and lithography.},

	url = {http://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/764211/},
	abstract = {Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is of great interest to those designing accelerators as drivers for free-electron lasers (FELs). Although experimental evidence is incomplete, CSR is predicted to have potentially severe effects on the emittance of high-brightness electron beams. The performance of an FEL depends critically on the emittance, current, and energy spread of the beam. Attempts to increase the current through magnetic bunch compression can lead to increased emittance and energy spread due to CSR in the dipoles of such a compressor. The code Ð ÒØ [1] was used for design and simulation of the bunch compressor [2] for the Low-Energy Undulator Test Line (LEUTL) FEL [3] at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). In order to facilitate this design, a fast algorithm was developed based on the 1-D formalism of Saldin and coworkers [4]. In addition, a plausible method of including CSR effects in drift spaces following the chicane magnets was developed and implemented. The algorithm is fast enough to permit running hundreds of tolerance simulations including CSR for 50 thousand particles. This article describes the details of the implementation and shows results for the APS bunch compressor.},

	abstract = {The phase space distribution and time structure of an electron beam have fundamental influences on synchrotron radiation properties. These influences are due to the superposition of radiation from all electrons, each following a different trajectory. When the radiation wavelength is longer than the electron bunch length, coherent superposition occurs and results in the observed coherent synchrotron radiation. Usually the wavelength we use is much shorter, so incoherent superposition occurs and the emittance effect is the dominant multi-electron effect. The Monte Carlo simulation is a straightforward and generally valid approach to compute the multi-electron effects on synchrotron radiation. In this paper, we show how the Monte Carlo method can model these multi-electron effects systematically and discuss the statistical principles governing such simulation and their implication on the computing power requirement. We also describe the implementation of an efficient algorithm to calculate a single electron radiation spectrum, which is important to make the Monte Carlo simulation practical. Some calculated results are shown to demonstrate the methods. Comments on the usefulness and limitation of the Monte Carlo method are presented.},

In comparison with traditional lithographic resists, the ceramic-like nature of the silsesquioxanes offers many advantages in terms of the mechanical and physical properties that are important for nanoscale patterning media. Beyond just creating physical patterns, silsesquioxanes can also be engineered to exhibit a wide range of functional properties that transcend the notion of resists being used singularly as a sacrificial component to transfer a pattern into functional materials. In this manuscript we will highlight some of the salient chemistries behind these materials that are relevant to nanoscale patterning applications and review the technical applications where patterned silsesquioxanes are being seriously considered.},

Within these mechanistic regimes, a large number of methods are summarized and further classified into subcategories based on the specific reagents, catalysts, etc., involved. To provide a clear understanding of each subcategory, reaction mechanisms are discussed. In addition, applications of photo-CRP reported so far, which include surface fabrication, particle preparation, photoresponsive gel design, and continuous flow technology, are summarized. We hope this review will not only provide informative knowledge to researchers in this field but also stimulate new ideas and applications to further advance photocontrolled reactions.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the thermal and radiation chemistry of an organotin-based model photoresist to elucidate patterning mechanisms related to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Butyltin oxide hydroxide (BuSnOOH) was dissolved in organic solvents and spin-coated to form uniform thin films. The thermal stability and radiation sensitivity of the thin films were characterized by temperature programmed desorption (TPD), electron stimulated desorption (ESD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From the TPD studies, we determined that decomposition of BuSnOOH occurs at {\textasciitilde}653 K through cleavage of the butyl-tin bond. Low kinetic energy electron (Ekin = 80 eV) and X-ray (1486.6 eV) exposure also resulted in cleavage of the butyl-tin bond with the resulting desorption of butyl ligands from the film. From the ESD data, we estimated that the butyl ligand desorption cross section was {\textasciitilde}4.3 × 10−14 cm2 for electrons with 80 eV kinetic energy. From the XPS results, we found a significant reduction in C 1s intensity for extended X-ray exposures, which corresponds to butyl ligand loss. There were also changes in the O 1s spectra indicating loss of hydroxyl groups and tin oxide network formation during radiation exposure. These results indicate the preferential dissociation and desorption of butyl ligands that can occur through either thermal or radiation induced processes, and that butyl ligand loss leads to the solubility contrast.},

	abstract = {While EUV systems equipped with a 0.33 Numerical Aperture (NA) lens are readying to start high volume manufacturing, ASML and ZEISS are in parallel ramping up their activities on an EUV exposure tool with an NA of 0.55. The purpose of this high-NA scanner, targeting an ultimate resolution of 8nm, is to extend Moore’s law throughout the next decade. A novel lens design, capable of providing the required Numerical Aperture, has been identified; this lens will be paired with new, faster stages and more accurate sensors enabling the tight focus and overlay control needed for future process nodes. In this paper an update will be given on the status of the developments at ZEISS and ASML. Next to this, we will address several topics inherent in the new design and smaller target resolution: M3D effects, polarization, focus control and stitching.},

	abstract = {The European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (FEL) became the first operational high-repetition-rate hard X-ray FEL with first lasing in May 2017. Biological structure determination has already benefitted from the unique properties and capabilities of X-ray FELs, predominantly through the development and application of serial crystallography. The possibility of now performing such experiments at data rates more than an order of magnitude greater than previous X-ray FELs enables not only a higher rate of discovery but also new classes of experiments previously not feasible at lower data rates. One example is time-resolved experiments requiring a higher number of time steps for interpretation, or structure determination from samples with low hit rates in conventional X-ray FEL serial crystallography. Following first lasing at the European XFEL, initial commissioning and operation occurred at two scientific instruments, one of which is the Single Particles, Clusters and Biomolecules and Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SPB/SFX) instrument. This instrument provides a photon energy range, focal spot sizes and diagnostic tools necessary for structure determination of biological specimens. The instrumentation explicitly addresses serial crystallography and the developing single particle imaging method as well as other forward-scattering and diffraction techniques. This paper describes the major science cases of SPB/SFX and its initial instrumentation – in particular its optical systems, available sample delivery methods, 2D detectors, supporting optical laser systems and key diagnostic components. The present capabilities of the instrument will be reviewed and a brief outlook of its future capabilities is also described.},

	abstract = {A simple model for image formation in linear shift-invariant systems is considered, in which both the detected signal and the noise variance are varying slowly compared to the point-spread function of the system. It is shown that within the constraints of this model, the square of the signal-to-noise ratio is always proportional to the “volume” of the spatial resolution unit. In the case of Poisson statistics, the ratio of these two quantities divided by the incident density of the imaging particles (e.g. photons) represents a dimensionless invariant of the imaging system, which was previously termed the intrinsic imaging quality. The relationship of this invariant to the notion of information capacity of communication and imaging systems, which was previously considered by Shannon, Gabor and others, is investigated. The results are then applied to a simple generic model of quantitative imaging of weakly scattering objects, leading to an estimate of the upper limit for the amount of information about the sample that can be obtained in such experiments. It is shown that this limit depends only on the total number of imaging particles incident on the sample, the average scattering coefficient, the size of the sample and the number of spatial resolution units.},

However, it appears that rigorous definitions of these quantities, which would be general enough to be useful in a broad range of imaging problems, while being also sufficiently specific to enable precise quantitative evaluation of the relevant properties of imaging systems, have been somewhat lacking. This is particularly true in respect to many modern forms of imaging that include digital processing of the acquired imaging data as an integral step leading to final images presented to the enduser. In the present paper, both the well-known historical definitions of spatial resolution and some more recent approaches suitable for many modern computational imaging techniques are discussed. An intrinsic duality of the spatial resolution and signal-to-noise exists in almost all types of imaging, with the related uncertainty relationship determining the inevitable trade-offs between the two quantities. Examples are presented with applications to some forms of X-ray imaging. Relations to Shannon and Fisher information capacity of imaging systems and super-resolution are also briefly discussed.},

In this way, thermally activated parameters that contribute to blur (such as acid/base diffusion) can be separated from non-thermally activated parameters (such as secondary electron blur). The experimental results are analyzed in detail using multi-wavelength resist modeling based on the continuum approach and through fitting of the EUV data using stochastic resist models. The extracted blur kinetics display perfectly linear Arrhenius behavior, indicating that there is no sign for secondary electron blur at 22nm half pitch. At the lowest PEB setting the total blur length is {\textasciitilde}4nm, indicating that secondary electron blur should be well below that. The stochastic resist model gives a best fit to the current data set with parameters that result in a maximum probability of acid generation at 2.4nm from the photon absorption site. Extrapolation of the model predicts that towards the 16nm half pitch the impact on sizing dose is minimal and an acceptable exposure latitude is achievable. In order to limit the impact on line width roughness at these dimensions it will be required to control acid diffusion to {\textasciitilde}5nm.},

The field was born 50 years ago with the first measures of genetic variation in allozyme loci, continued with the nucleotide sequencing era, and is currently in the era of population genomics. During this period, molecular population genetics has been revolutionized by progress in data acquisition and theoretical developments. The conceptual elegance of the neutral theory of molecular evolution or the footprint carved by natural selection on the patterns of genetic variation are two examples of the vast number of inspiring findings of population genetics research. Since the inception of the field, Drosophila has been the prominent model species: molecular variation in populations was first described in Drosophila and most of the population genetics hypotheses were tested in Drosophila species. In this review, we describe the main concepts, methods, and landmarks of molecular population genetics, using the Drosophila model as a reference. We describe the different genetic data sets made available by advances in molecular technologies, and the theoretical developments fostered by these data. Finally, we review the results and new insights provided by the population genomics approach, and conclude by enumerating challenges and new lines of inquiry posed by increasingly large population scale sequence data.},

Addition of M uncorrelated speckle patterns on an intensity basis can reduce the contrast by 1/√M. However, addition of speckle patterns on a complex amplitude basis provides no reduction of contrast.

However, most implementations developed to take advantage of this framework revolve around controlling the measurements with carefully engineered material or acquisition sequences. Instead, we use the natural randomness of wave propagation through multiply scattering media as an optimal and instantaneous compressive imaging mechanism. Waves reflected from an object are detected after propagation through a well-characterized complex medium. Each local measurement thus contains global information about the object, yielding a purely analog compressive sensing method. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for optical imaging by using a 300-micrometer thick layer of white paint as the compressive imaging device. Scattering media are thus promising candidates for designing efficient and compact compressive imagers.},

	abstract = {The spatial random-effects model is flexible in modeling spatial covariance functions, and is computationally efficient for spatial prediction via fixed rank kriging. However, the success of this model depends on an appropriate set of basis functions. In this research, we propose a class of basis functions extracted from thin-plate splines. These functions are ordered in terms of their degrees of smoothness with a higher-order function corresponding to larger-scale features and a lower-order one corresponding to smaller-scale details, leading to a parsimonious representation for a nonstationary spatial covariance function. Consequently, only a small to moderate number of functions are needed in a spatial random-effects model. The proposed class of basis functions has several advantages over commonly used ones. First, we do not need to concern about the allocation of the basis functions, but simply select the total number of functions corresponding to a resolution. Second, only a small number of basis functions is usually required, which facilitates computation. Third, estimation variability of model parameters can be considerably reduced, and hence more precise covariance function estimates can be obtained. Fourth, the proposed basis functions depend only on the data locations but not the measurements taken at those locations, and are applicable regardless of whether the data locations are sparse or irregularly spaced. In addition, we derive a simple close-form expression for the maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters in the spatial random-effects model. Some numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Comparisons with respect to computational time and prediction performance via functional cross-validation is evaluated, mainly through a simulation study but also on a real data set. We restrict comparisons to Sp.T. kriging versus ordinary kriging for functional data (OKFD), since the more ﬂexible functional kriging approaches pointwise functional kriging (PWFK) and the functional kriging total model coincide with OKFD in several situations. Here we formulate conditions under which we show that OKFD and PWFK coincide. From the simulation study, it is concluded that the prediction performance of the two kriging approaches in general is rather equal for stationary Sp.T. processes. However, functional kriging tends to perform better for small sample sizes, while Sp.T. kriging works better for large sizes. For non-stationary Sp.T. processes, with a common deterministic time trend and/or time varying variances and dependence structure, OKFD performs better than Sp.T. kriging irrespective of the sample size. For all simulated cases, the computational time for OKFD was considerably lower compared to those for the Sp.T. kriging methods.},

	abstract = {Arbitrary distributions of radiant exposure may be written by transversely scanning a single known spatially-random screen that is normally illuminated by spatially but not necessarily temporally uniform radiation or matter wave fields. The arbitrariness, of the written pattern of radiant exposure, holds up to both (i) a spatial resolution that is dictated by the characteristic transverse length scale of the illuminated spatially random screen, and (ii) a background term that grows linearly with the number of random-illumination patterns. Two classes of the method are developed. The former assumes the distance between the illuminated random mask and the target plane to be sufficiently small that the effects of diffraction may be neglected. The latter accounts for the effects of Fresnel diffraction in the regime of large Fresnel number. Numerical simulations are provided for both variants of the method. Contrast and signal-to-noise ratio are also considered. The method may be parallelized, and is suited to both magnifying and de-magnifying geometries. Possible applications include spatial light modulators and intensity projectors for those matter and radiation wave fields for which such devices do not exist, printing or micro-fabrication in both two and three spatial dimensions, and lithography.},

Namely rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA), Kogelnik's two-wave method, and the scalar method of transmittance have been applied to study diffraction characteristics and have been compared, and their applicability has been determined. For comparison purposes, a binary surface-relief grating made from an isotropic non-absorbing substrate in the planar diffraction regime, and a transverse electric polarized incident wave, are considered in this paper. Additionally, by calculating the diffraction efficiency of such gratings using the RCWA method, with special respect to grating profile depth and period, it was possible to describe and explain the complex behaviour of diffraction efficiency, that is to find regions with typical diffraction regimes, of all gratings of a chosen kind, in this case given by the binary grating profile. Moreover, it has been shown how the classical scalar transmittance method for analysis of thin diffraction gratings can be modified by an estimation of the propagation process through the grating depth in order to describe the volume phase synchronism dependence on the relative grating period.},

	abstract = {We present a general approach to thin bulk samples to transparency for experiments in the           soft x-ray and extreme ultraviolet spectral range. The method relies on mechanical           grinding followed by focused-ion-beam milling. It results in a uniformly thin area of high           surface quality, suitable for nanoscale imaging in transmission. In a proof-of-principle           experiment, nanoscale magnetic bits on a commercial hard drive glass disk are imaged with           a spatial resolution below 30 nm by soft x-ray spectro-holography. Furthermore, we           demonstrate imaging of a lithographically patterned test object via absorption contrast.           Our approach is suitable for both amorphous and crystalline substrates and has been tested           for a variety of common epitaxy growth substrates. Lateral thinning areas in excess of 100             μm2 and a remaining substrate thickness as thin as 150 nm are easily           achievable. Our approach allows preserving a previously grown thin film, and from           nanofocus electron diffraction, we find no evidence for morphological changes induced by           the process, in agreement with numerical simulations of the ion implantation depth           distributon. We expect our method to be widely applicable and especially useful for           nanoscale imaging of epitaxial thin films.},

	abstract = {Microcrystals present a significant impediment to the determination of macromolecular structures by X-ray diffraction methods. Although microfocus synchrotron beamlines and X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) can enable the collection of interpretable diffraction data from microcrystals, there is a need for efficient methods of harvesting small volumes ({\textless}2 µl) of microcrystals grown under common laboratory formats and delivering them to an X-ray beam source under native growth conditions. One approach that shows promise in overcoming the challenges intrinsic to microcrystal analysis is to pair so-called `fixed-target' sample-delivery devices with microbeam-based X-ray diffraction methods. However, to record weak diffraction patterns it is necessary to fabricate devices from X-ray-transparent materials that minimize background scattering. Presented here is the design of a new micro-diffraction device consisting of three layers fabricated from silicon nitride, photoresist and polyimide film. The chip features low X-ray scattering and X-ray absorption properties, and uses a customizable blend of hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface patterns to help localize microcrystals to defined regions. Microcrystals in their native growth conditions can be loaded into the chips with a standard pipette, allowing data collection at room temperature. Diffraction data collected from hen egg-white lysozyme microcrystals (10–15 µm) loaded into the chips yielded a complete, high-resolution ({\textless}1.6 Å) data set sufficient to determine a high-quality structure by molecular replacement. The features of the chip allow the rapid and user-friendly analysis of microcrystals grown under virtually any laboratory format at microfocus synchrotron beamlines and XFELs.},

For the experimental case we present this allows the acquisition of CDI data in just 5 seconds compared to 20 minutes for full coherence.

Ptychography meanwhile has been developed independently as a method of reconstructing the transmission function of extended objects from diffraction data recorded using a sequence of multiple overlapping probes on the sample. The relatively recent combination of these two methods has been found to provide substantial benefits over either of the two techniques when applied separately.

Radiation-induced damage, however, imposes a practical limit to image resolution, and as such, a choice between damage, image contrast, and image resolution must be made. New coherent diffractive imaging techniques, such Fresnel Coherent Diffractive Imaging (FCDI), allows quantitative phase information with exceptional dose efficiency, high contrast, and nano-scale resolution. Here we present three-dimensional quantitative images of a whole eukaryotic cell by FCDI at a spatial resolution below 70 nm with sufficient phase contrast to distinguish major cellular components. From our data, we estimate that the minimum dose required for a similar resolution is close to that predicted by the Rose criterion, considerably below accepted estimates of the maximum dose a frozen-hydrated cell can tolerate. Based on the dose efficiency, contrast, and resolution achieved, we expect this technique will find immediate applications in tomographic cellular characterisation.},

This requires in situ studies to provide observables that contribute to both modeling beyond the phenomenological level and transducing exactly the functionally relevant quantities A range of X-ray coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) approaches has recently been proposed for imaging beyond the diffraction limit with potentially dramatic improvements of time resolution with chemical sensitivity. In this paper we report a selection of ptychography results obtained in situ after successive steps of electrochemically driven growth, complemented with absorption and phase spectroscopy at high lateral resolution. We demonstrate the onset of morphological instability feature formation and correlate the chemical state of Mn with local growth rate controlled by the current density distribution resulting from morphological evolution.},

Here, we combine two distinct measurements of ultrastructure and elemental distribution, with each measurement performed under optimised conditions. By combining optimised ptychography and fluorescence information we are able to determine molar concentrations from two-dimensional images, allowing an investigation into the interactions between the environment sensing filopodia in fibroblasts and extracellular calcium. Furthermore, the biological ptychography results we present illustrate a point of maturity where the technique can be applied to solve significant problems in structural biology.},

As numerical aperture increases to unity and beyond, to cope with the continuous demand for shrinking integrated circuits, device dimensions, and densities, this approximation is no longer valid. In this paper we use the physical theory of diffraction to study, understand, and model the variation of light diffracted from photo mask structures of the order of the wavelength, with the angle of light incidence. We present a semianalytical model that is fast, accurate, and compatible with existing professional software in this domain. The accuracy of the model is studied using the finite-difference time-domain technique and is shown to be below 5\% at the image plane, within angles of incidence between ±20°.},

	abstract = {A Unified Summary of the Models and Optimization Methods Used in Computational Lithography Optical lithography is one of the most challenging areas of current integrated circuit manufacturing technology. The semiconductor industry is relying more on resolution enhancement techniques (RETs), since their implementation does not require significant changes in fabrication infrastructure. Computational Lithography is the first book to address the computational optimization of RETs in optical lithography, providing an in-depth discussion of optimal optical proximity correction (OPC), phase shifting mask (PSM), and off-axis illumination (OAI) RET tools that use model-based mathematical optimization approaches. The book starts with an introduction to optical lithography systems, electric magnetic field principles, and the fundamentals of optimization from a mathematical point of view. It goes on to describe in detail different types of optimization algorithms to implement RETs. Most of the algorithms developed are based on the application of the OPC, PSM, and OAI approaches and their combinations. Algorithms for coherent illumination as well as partially coherent illumination systems are described, and numerous simulations are offered to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms. In addition, mathematical derivations of all optimization frameworks are presented. The accompanying MATLAB® software files for all the RET methods described in the book make it easy for readers to run and investigate the codes in order to understand and apply the optimization algorithms, as well as to design a set of optimal lithography masks. The codes may also be used by readers for their research and development activities in their academic or industrial organizations. An accompanying MATLAB® software guide is also included. An accompanying MATLAB® software guide is included, and readers can download the software to use with the guide at ftp://ftp.wiley.com/public/sci\_tech\_med/computational\_lithography. Tailored for both entry-level and experienced readers, Computational Lithography is meant for faculty, graduate students, and researchers, as well as scientists and engineers in industrial organizations whose research or career field is semiconductor IC fabrication, optical lithography, and RETs. Computational lithography draws from the rich theory of inverse problems, optics, optimization, and computational imaging; as such, the book is also directed to researchers and practitioners in these fields.},

The first is the 3D structural determination of noncrystalline materials, which includes the localization of the defects and strain field inside nanocrystals, and quantitative 3D imaging of disordered materials such as nanoparticles and biomaterials. The second is the 3D imaging of frozen-hydrated whole cells at a resolution of 10 nm or better. A main thrust is to localize specific multiprotein complexes inside cells. The third is the potential of imaging single large protein complexes using extremely intense and ultrashort X-ray pulses.

	abstract = {Wideband analog signals push contemporary analog-to-digital conversion systems to their performance limits. In many applications, however, sampling at the Nyquist rate is inefﬁcient because the signals of interest contain only a small number of signiﬁcant frequencies relative to the bandlimit, although the locations of the frequencies may not be known a priori. For this type of sparse signal, other sampling strategies are possible. This paper describes a new type of data acquisition system, called a random demodulator, that is constructed from robust, readily available components. Let K denote the total number of frequencies in the signal, and let W denote its bandlimit in Hz. Simulations suggest that the random demodulator requires just O(K log(W/K)) samples per second to stably reconstruct the signal. This sampling rate is exponentially lower than the Nyquist rate of W Hz. In contrast with Nyquist sampling, one must use nonlinear methods, such as convex programming, to recover the signal from the samples taken by the random demodulator. This paper provides a detailed theoretical analysis of the system’s performance that supports the empirical observations.},

Finally, we present a semi-analytical method for the modeling of post exposure bake process in 3D. With these enhancements in the algorithm, a typical 3D latent image problem can be solved in a few seconds on a workstation.},

Grazing incidence X-ray reﬂectometry, cross-section TEM, and in-depth XPS analysis of B/La and B4C/La multilayers reveal chemical reactivity at the interfaces. Signiﬁcant LaBx interlayer formation is observed in especially B/La multilayers, stressing the relevance of interface passivation.

It is discussed in this article that the power scaling of the 13.5nm wavelength source is essentially possible by a slight increase of the driving laser power, CE (Conversion Efficiency) and EUV collection efficiency by some introduction of novel component technologies. Extension of the EUV wavelength towards BEUV (Beyond EUV), namely 6.x nm is discussed based on the general rule of the UTA (Unresolved Transition Arrays) of high Z ions, and development of multilayer mirrors in this particular wavelength region. Technical difficulties are evaluated for the extension of the LPP source technology by considering the narrower mirror bandwidth and higher melting temperature of the candidate plasma materials. Alternative approach based on the superconducting FEL is evaluated in comparison with the LPP source technology for the future solution.},

The object of the present dissertation is not so much to pro­pose any opinions which are absolutely new, as to refer some theories, which have been already advanced, to their original inventors, to support them by additional evidence, and to apply them to a great number of diversified facts, which have hitherto been buried in obscurity. Nor is it absolutely necessary in this instance to produce a single new experiment; for of experi­ments there is already an ample store, which are so much the more unexceptionable, as they must have been conducted with­ out the least partiality for the system by which they will be explained; yet some facts, hitherto unobserved, will be brought forwards, in order to show the perfect agreement of that system with the multifarious phenomena of nature.},

	abstract = {Relativistic charged-particle beams, when accelerated in a direction transverse to the direction of motion, emit copious quantities of electromagnetic radiation. This radiation is naturally and inevitably emitted when deflection magnets constrain the particles in circular accelerators to their closed orbits, and it is also emitted when charged particles circulate through specific devices known as wigglers and undulators. The radiation is pitched into an angular cone of characteristic angle 1/γ, where γ is the ratio of the kinetic energy of the particle to its rest energyE/mc 2. The spectral properties of the radiation are governed by the nature of the deflection field: for the incoherent sources (bend magnets and wigglers), the radiation is broadband with a characteristic wavelength λ {\textasciitilde} ρ/ γ3, whereρ is the instantaneous radius of curvature; for the periodic sources, the radiation is quasimonochromatic with characteristic wavelength λ{\textasciitilde}λ u /γ2, where λ u is the period of the device. The radiation can be strongly polarized, depending upon the details of the particle acceleration. Finally, the radiation emerges with the pulsed properties of the electron beam, which may involve a time scale of 10 psec or less. For these reasons, synchrotron radiation can be a far more intense source of vacuum ultraviolet, soft X-ray, and hard X-ray radiation than conventional sources, which generally rely upon inner-shell vacancy production or bremsstrahlung by intense electron beams.},

We present an experimental technique of the spatial (transverse and longitudinal) characterization of the beam proﬁle. Investigating ablative imprints in various materials, we evaluate the spatial properties of the incident beam, namely, the beam waist radius and position, the Rayleigh range, M2 parameter, and divergence. In this paper, we recall brieﬂy our recent work at the transverse beam proﬁle reconstruction.

Double pinhole diffraction patterns of single femtosecond pulses focused to a size of about 10 microns by 10 microns were measured. A transverse coherence length of 6.2 microns in the horizontal and 8.7 microns in the vertical direction was determined from the most coherent pulses. Using a split and delay unit the coherence time of the pulses produced in the same operation conditions of FLASH was measured to be 1.75 fs. From our experiment we estimated the degeneracy parameter of the FLASH beam to be on the order of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$, which exceeds the values of this parameter at any other source in the same energy range by many orders of magnitude.},

A model describing non-thermal desorption and ablation has been developed and used to analyze single-shot imprints in PMMA. An intermediate regime of materials removal has been found, confirming model predictions. We also report below-threshold multiple-shot desorption of PMMA induced by high-order harmonics (HOH) at 32 nm. Short-time exposure imprints provide sufficient information about transverse beam profile in HOH's tight focus whereas long-time exposed PMMA exhibits radiation-initiated surface ardening making the beam profile measurement infeasible.},

	abstract = {The European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (FEL) became the first operational high-repetition-rate hard X-ray FEL with first lasing in May 2017. Biological structure determination has already benefitted from the unique properties and capabilities of X-ray FELs, predominantly through the development and application of serial crystallography. The possibility of now performing such experiments at data rates more than an order of magnitude greater than previous X-ray FELs enables not only a higher rate of discovery but also new classes of experiments previously not feasible at lower data rates. One example is time-resolved experiments requiring a higher number of time steps for interpretation, or structure determination from samples with low hit rates in conventional X-ray FEL serial crystallography. Following first lasing at the European XFEL, initial commissioning and operation occurred at two scientific instruments, one of which is the Single Particles, Clusters and Biomolecules and Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SPB/SFX) instrument. This instrument provides a photon energy range, focal spot sizes and diagnostic tools necessary for structure determination of biological specimens. The instrumentation explicitly addresses serial crystallography and the developing single particle imaging method as well as other forward-scattering and diffraction techniques. This paper describes the major science cases of SPB/SFX and its initial instrumentation – in particular its optical systems, available sample delivery methods, 2D detectors, supporting optical laser systems and key diagnostic components. The present capabilities of the instrument will be reviewed and a brief outlook of its future capabilities is also described.},

	abstract = {Recently, the European X-Ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) has successfully produced its ﬁrst X-ray photon pulse trains. This unique photon source will provide up to 27 000 photon pulses per second for experiments in different ﬁelds of science. In order to accomplish this, ultra-precise mirrors of dedicated shape are used to guide and focus these photons along beamlines of up to 930 m in length from the source in the undulator section to the desired focal point at an experimental station. We will report on a Kirkpatrick-Baez-mirror pair designed to focus hard-X-rays in the energy range from 3 to 16 keV to a 100 nm scale at the SPB/SFX instrument of the European XFEL. Both mirrors are elliptical cylinder-like shaped. The ﬁgure error of these 1 m long mirrors was speciﬁed to be better than 2 nm pv in terms of the height domain; this corresponds to a slope error of about 50 nrad rms (at least a best effort ﬁnishing is requested). This is essential to provide optimal experimental conditions including preservation of brilliance and wavefront. Such large and precise optics represents a challenge for the required deterministic surface polishing technology, elastic emission machining in this case, as well as for the metrology mandatory to enable a precise characterization of the topography on the mirror aperture. Besides the slope errors, the ellipse parameters are also of particular interest. The mirrors were under inspection by means of slope measuring deﬂectometry at the BESSY-NOM slope measuring proﬁler at the Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin. The NOM measurements have shown a slope error of 100 nrad rms on a aperture length of 950 mm corresponding to a residual ﬁgure deviation ≤20 nm pv for both mirrors. Additionally we found a strong impact of the mirror support conditions on the mirror shape ﬁnally measured. We will report on the measurement concept to characterize such mirrors as well as to discuss the achieved results.},

The XFEL provides photons in an energy range between 0.2 and 24.8 keV [1]. XFELs unique time structure comprises bunch trains at a repetition rate of 10 Hz, where each train consists of 2700 bunches with a temporal separation of 220 ns. Each bunch itself consists of ∼ 1012 photons impinging in less than 100 fs. The challenges posed by this time structure will be addressed using a charge integrating device with dynamic gain switching and the possibility to store the analog signals on at least 200 storage cells. Up to now, three different prototype chips have been built, in order to investigate the different blocks of the final AGIPD chip. This paper will report on the results of the characterization of the first two prototype chips, namely AGIPD0.1 and AGIPD0.2. While the investigations on AGIPD0.1 focus on the readout chain (dynamic gain switching, linearity, etc.), the tests of AGIPD0.2 concentrate on the measurements involving the bump-bonded silicon sensor, such as the possibility of resolving single photons and pixel-to-pixel variations as well as the performance of the analog storage pipeline.},

	abstract = {In the early 1990s, Church and Takacs pointed out that the specification of surface figure and finish of x-ray mirrors must be based on their performance in the beamline optical system. We demonstrate the limitations of specification, characterization, and performance evaluation based on conventional statistical approaches, including root-mean-square roughness and residual slope variation, evaluated over spatial frequency bandwidths that are system specific, and a more refined description of the surface morphology based on the power spectral density distribution. We show that these limitations are fatal, especially in the case of highly collimated coherent x-ray beams, like beams from x-ray free electron lasers (XFELs). The limitations arise due to the deterministic character of the surface profile data for a definite mirror, while the specific correlation properties of the surface are essential for the performance of the entire x-ray optical system. As a possible way to overcome the problem, we treat a method, suggested by Yashchuk and Yashchuk in 2012, based on an autoregressive moving average modeling of the slope measurements with a limited number of parameters. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated with an example specific to the x-ray optical systems under design at the European XFEL.},

	abstract = {In the past few years, X-ray phase-contrast and dark-field imaging have evolved to be invaluable tools for non-destructive sample visualisation, delivering information inaccessible by conventional absorption imaging. X-ray phase-sensing techniques are furthermore increasingly used for at-wavelength metrology and optics characterisation. One of the latest additions to the group of differential phase-contrast methods is the X-ray speckle-based technique. It has drawn significant attention due to its simple and flexible experimental arrangement, cost-effectiveness and multimodal character, amongst others. Since its first demonstration at highly brilliant synchrotron sources, the method has seen rapid development, including the translation to polychromatic laboratory sources and extension to higher-energy X-rays. Recently, different advanced acquisition schemes have been proposed to tackle some of the main limitations of previous implementations. Current applications of the speckle-based method range from optics characterisation and wavefront measurement to biomedical imaging and materials science. This review provides an overview of the state of the art of the X-ray speckle-based technique. Its basic principles and different experimental implementations as well as the the latest advances and applications are illustrated. In the end, an outlook for anticipated future developments of this promising technique is given.},

We also recall how such methods can facilitate online optimization of active optics.},
